51,"Although quality education is now becoming more and more popular, students are no longer simply pursuing scores. However, because the competition among different students still exists, the education of children is still the biggest problem that plagues parents. Whether it is Xiaoshengchu, middle school or college entrance examination, it still affects the hearts of thousands of parents. The second season of the online drama &quot;The Evolution of Genius&quot; jointly created by Xueda Education and Lingsi Boiling Film has been officially launched. It has once again caused netizens to learn how to make children learn, how to stimulate children&#39;s interest in learning and how to develop their potential. A big discussion of &quot;little genius&quot;. After the 10th episode of the first season of &quot;Genius Evolution&quot; was launched, it achieved great success. The number of online hits exceeded 20 million. From this point, it is not difficult to see the importance parents attach to their children&#39;s education. The second season of &quot;The Theory of Genius Evolution&quot; was launched. The scene is still a personalized teaching center for the University of Education. The main teachers are Gao Xiaopan&#39;s Guo Mingxi and Mao Yuanjun&#39;s Tong Li, but the students are replaced by another one. ?? Do not think about learning ghost horse &quot;rich second generation&quot; Qi Yiguo, &quot;wolf dad&quot; to create a singular student Lu Bingbing, and Lin Yinan suffering from test anxiety. The same as the first season, the second season of &quot;Genius Evolution&quot; is also derived from the real educational story in reality. Through the &quot;individualized one-on-one&quot; education method of the teachers of the University of Education, the students&#39; minds were completely solved, the children&#39;s potential was developed, and they were no longer confused and depressed for learning. They were truly happy. Learn. It seems that Lin Yinan, who has always been a top student, is always in a state of tension. With the help of the education teacher, she finally regained her confidence and got rid of test anxiety. The rich second generation Qi also fruit, do not think about learning at all, the focus of attention every day is luxury goods, the teacher Tong Li teaches this in accordance with this material, shocked him with his famous cosmetics A hundred birds, so that he can start to listen to the class... And eventually get rid of the confusion about learning and truly realize myself. Through the transformation of Qi Yiguo, Lu Bingbing and Lin Yinan, we have realized that the most suitable education is the best education. Let us also understand the true meaning of &quot;personalization 1 to 1&quot; in the University of Education. In fact, personalized education and one-on-one education are not new terms, but combining them into one is the first of the majors. In recent years, education issues have received more and more attention. &quot;Genius Evolution 2&quot; can use the platform of micro-film to address the current educational difficulties through personalized education concepts.Provide an effective solution. Can&#39;t help but say that Xueda Education has a unique vision. For this reason, through the popular broadcast of the online drama, parents also began to pay attention to the education of the University, to understand the personalized one-to-one education, and gradually realized that letting children choose the learning style that suits them is the fundamental to improve their performance. As the pioneer of personalized education in China, the education of the University has been perfecting its personalized education system for many years. Just like Guo Mingxi and Tong Li in the drama, although the performance is exaggerated, it can also reflect the classroom. The concept of entertaining and learning, the characteristics of entertainment and education, and the concept of individualized education, let the children&#39;s &quot;teaching students in accordance with their aptitudes&quot; from the achievements to the growth of talents. It can be said that, as described in &quot;Genius Evolution Theory 2&quot;, Xueda Education has skillfully solved the various problems of contemporary teenagers in the study of reality through personalized education concepts! And this is also an important reason why more and more parents choose to study education!"
52,"I promised to write something after reading it, and I will just say a few words in the middle of the night. The film &quot;Little Times&quot; was sizzled from the early stage of the release. After the release, it was a group of people who were &quot;noisy&quot;, even from how to judge the quality of a movie to the division of human nature and the distortion of values. The problem, a large number of brain-dead black and brain powders have raised the flag team, and I look at the various reviews every day, but also enjoy themselves. The reason why I have never expressed my attitude is that I have always believed that film and television art, including all art forms, is ultimately something that needs self-feeling. As the saying goes, there is no right to speak without practice. Even if you don’t read it or you don’t read it, you are not qualified to comment. (Of course, this line is often popular, I actually did TAT.) At the same time, art has an aesthetic freedom, radish cabbage, and each has its own love. The cloud is also a blind obedience without a brain. After all, each person’s life experience is different from the knowledge. The appreciation of things is different. First: there is no speech without reading it; second: aesthetics is free. Just like every post-85 youth, there must be a Jay Chou, and every one after 85 years old has heard of Guo Jingming. When I first went to high school, Guo Jingming’s &quot;Fantasy City&quot; was buying hot, and then I also bought &quot;Island&quot;, &quot;The Summer Solstice&quot; and so on. At that time, reading Guo Jingming would feel that he was a partner of his neighbors. He could express his indescribable feelings in his own words in precise language. So I can understand why the majority of the 90s are still so obsessed with Guo Jingming. After the university, there were more things to watch. The &quot;Minimum Say&quot; was gradually less seen, and the young writer of that year gradually became a smart and capable businessman, and the magic of the drunken fans all supported his literary kingdom. In this way, knowing Guo Jingming is also a journey of ten years. The reason why I want to go back to this experience is to say that as a bystander, I also silently witnessed his step-by-step growth. Former Guo Jingming was a talented young writer, but now I am more willing to call him a successful businessman. In other words, accurately capturing market information, clearly targeting the needs of the audience and actively making adjustments is exactly what he has always been good at. In addition to this, it is indeed an important reason why he has achieved today&#39;s achievements. Perhaps you can deny Guo Jingming&#39;s achievements, scorn the economic wealth he has accumulated, or disdain for his luxury. (Don’t tell me about height, use oneIt’s the most shameless and ignorant thing that people’s appearances can’t be changed. However, as he said: the family is innocent, self-reliant, and starts from scratch. Therefore, he really deserves the love of so many people. (There are many ways to plagiarize, academic papers are copied all over the place, commercial works are only easier to see by the public. This thing is too deep to say, skip it for the time being) The last movie before &quot;Little Times&quot; (I don&#39;t want to say that it is a movie) is &quot;Folkwood Mountain Map&quot; with more than one star in the legend. That is the rotten film, and the aesthetic standards after being smashed by the rotten film may fall, if biased. Go back and see the second article above. The tone of the whole film is still adhering to the standard of visual feast. From the beginning of Shanghai&#39;s radiant architectural aerial photography, the audience should know that Shanghai in the film is the magical capital of the crowd, not the one. Narrow and dark alleys inside the alley. The people in the movie must also be glamorous and beautiful men and women, not the sloppy faces, screaming at the sleepy eyes. (Some comments are obviously untenable. What Shanghai is in the eyes of the author is unrealistic Shanghai. If you want to go to the official hall and go to the grassroots people in a movie, how about the news broadcast of your Tianchao? What are the main melody of the documentary channel? Everyone has a city of their own imagination and understanding, and there is a dream and reality. If you want to live in the uppercase, please pay attention to the life channel at 9 o&#39;clock every night.) The film opening is four girls high school. The graduation ceremony of the period, echoing the first and last paragraphs of the period, is also a friendship theme that reflects this part. The warmth of this treatment makes people see the cuteness of the four girls. After the opening, the main characters of the four girls have their own characteristics. The introduction of the characters in the morning is not only unique, but it is still in place. The audience knows the character and characteristics of several characters in a simple and clear way. It is also considered to be a character at the beginning of the film. However, the following will start to pick the thorns. (If you don’t say a little bit, I’m sorry, my aesthetics will not be said for a while, then I will be treated as a water army, but I’m just confiscating the world’s cultural money. So I’m not blind. I’m not terrible?) After the introduction of the characters Then, or with the narrative clues, or with the background, but the four girls on the campus poke on the playground dialogue does not make any sense, and around the lens, chasing the lens, etc. shooting techniques and characters performances, lines, etc.Very bad. The only explanation that this phenomenon can occur and emerge from the beginning is that the director wants the screenwriter to reproduce the classic scenes in the original. And exactly, these three are actually one person. And this is the first big problem in this film. (This point, the rest of the people can be uncomfortable to explain this reason can be explained clearly) including Lin Xiao and the palace? In the first dialogue between the elevators, many bridge sections can also be deleted or adapted. Despite the addition of some novel dialogues, they are always small and clever, so they are even more pale. Another example is the scene when Gu Li and Gu Yuan quarreled, and so on. Here is to explain: the three names of director, scriptwriter, original work, etc. can not be confused, the responsibility of each division is very important, if they are all the same, then why did you create different words? If these are due to Guo Jingming&#39;s separation of the triangle and the embarrassment caused by his own work, then the next big problem is the film&#39;s &quot;audio-visual language&quot; problem as a newcomer. Xicheng and Nanxiang bid farewell to this scene, the director used a shaking hand-held lens to shoot, the purpose may be to want to reflect the emotional fluctuations of the characters through the shaking of the lens. However, because there was not enough floor covering before the plot, what the audience saw was just a close-up of the disturbing shaking. The same problem here is that Lin Xiao broke the palace? The expensive water cup, if a few simple cuts or montages can be used here or the emotion can be expressed more fully, but the director chooses to use the big rocker to surround the shooting, The audience who was appeased by the appetite was expecting the ups and downs of the plot, but finally found that it was just breaking a cup. At the same time, there are still two long shots of the show. In fact, if I didn&#39;t pay more attention to it later, I really didn&#39;t see how long it took to make the long shot out of the film. All lens expressions must be based on enough emotional maturity and narrative clues, otherwise montage, long shots and other techniques can only be boring. It&#39;s like many newcomers think they like to use mirrors to express emotions, but they don&#39;t know that true emotions can sometimes be expressed with just one eye. (I didn&#39;t speak for a newcomer). I would like to make a third. This third is a problem that often occurs in all novel adaptations of movies. For the film adaptation of the novel, the starting point is often based on the visual adaptation of the existing story, rather than constructing the story based on the film&#39;s own characteristics.. To put it simply, the increase or decrease of the story itself is based on the fact that most viewers already have a certain understanding of the original content. Even if the plot is a little confusing, the audience familiar with the original can also make up for it. (For details, please refer to some works in &quot;Ha&quot;.) Literature and film itself are two completely different art forms, so the creative process and appreciation angles cannot be exactly the same. The adaptation of literary works into film and television works inevitably faces two situations: one is an audience who knows or is very familiar with the original work. Their audiences are already aware of the character and plot of the characters. Their Appreciation points are based more on the imagery of the existing imagination in the mind; while the other group has almost no knowledge of the original, (this is normal, &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot; is not everyone&#39;s read) their pure embrace A mentality of appreciation for film works, they want to see the vivid character, the storyline of the ups and downs, the real emotional expression, rather than the big part of the key plot. Obviously, &quot;Little Times&quot; is positioned as the former. Those who have read the work can clearly understand the relationship between the characters and the plot, and even have their own different expectations in the key emotional nodes. However, if you abandon all the knowledge backgrounds related to the original work in your mind, only in the state presented in the movie, there will be characters such as many critics who say words, fuzzy narrative clues, lack of drama conflicts, and only It is a simple pile of a lot of useless lines. It is precisely because it is positioned to meet the expectations of the vast majority of people who have an understanding of the original work on the visual reduction of the image in the book (the paper will be written more, then it will not be said). Therefore, it can be understood why the chase scene of the school did not reach a sufficient background, why the key drama of Lin Xiao’s reminder is so tepid, why the sorrowful and happy Christmas night scenes are so awkward, The emotional changes in the characters are so mixed. Although the film critics are &quot;heartbroken&quot;. Facts have proved that this position is correct. Most of the hundreds of millions of box-offices in Small Times rely on those who have read novels. The three major injuries in the film are the most important things to pay attention to throughout the film. The remaining issues such as the choice of actors, Yang Mi&#39;s acting problems, Jane Creek, which is not supported by the mud, and the sudden background music problems are in fact irrelevant. In addition, isn&#39;t there anyone who has seen the &quot;1&quot; in the small age on the poster from the beginning? It is clear that Guo Jingming is throwing fish.The bait is lined up and there is a sequel to the back. Therefore, the so-called no plot conflict, the character only shows the role of not shaping, etc. In fact, people can use a sentence: &quot;Please see the next section&quot; to answer, by the way also promoted the sequel. The first is that the details of the entire film are very well done. (I always think that people who don&#39;t understand things in big things tend to be particularly good at the details, cough, I am talking about myself.) The details I refer to refer to the extras except the visual focus of the whole film. The costumes, the details of the characters, and so on are all very fine, so the film is really beautiful. Or, to replace all the lines with subtitles, and then match the music is a great music movie (I am not a black family). Secondly, the film&#39;s propaganda planning was very successful. As we all know, the current film market competition is not only its own art works, but the marketing planning of the works is a key factor for success. From the very beginning of the film information release, to the character selection, to the fixed makeup photo, the release of the tidbits and so on, each step fully mobilized the audience&#39;s attention. The subsequent Weibo wars pushed the work to a fever. For the time being, the pros and cons of this kind of practice are just that the preparation for actively promoting their own works is enough for many practitioners to study hard. In today&#39;s society, art is no longer high in the pure white, the commodity attributes in art are more and more strong, the film bears the brunt, and as its marketization continues to deepen its own commercial attributes are also more intense. He also holds the glass heart of a people&#39;s artist. The treatment of the audience is not a respectful teaching. It is a sorrowful sorrow. If you are high-ranking but can&#39;t pick it, such a person is really humiliating the art of film. I always feel that if you say a movie, you can say the text well. If the analysis is thorough, it will be enough. The basics of rising to the height of culture are that you really don&#39;t know what to say. Some people say that this film is distorted. I have seen a group of young people who have dreams and struggles. There are no hidden rules, and there are no second-generation deceptions. Some people say that the film promotes the extravagant style of corruption, and there are several obvious logos of Nike, Bentley, and Hermes. They don’t hold small books and secretly count them. In fact, there are not too many brands to bomb. Some people say that women in this film like the extravagant life of material and the handsome male color. I really laughed. Not to mention the love of luxury, advocating the male color is from where to look, just ask, you do not like the appearance of exquisite, strong body, outstanding ability, temperament out of the group, the family is good, but prefers to smash the melons, sit on the ground,Nothing long, nothing? Then I can only say that you are old-minded and quick-moving. In the world built by Guo Jingming, the memory is very short and the growth is very cruel, so people who go to college must start to remember the pure high school era. In fact, this book is understandable, let alone &quot;the young people do not know the taste&quot;, each age has its own distress. Since the 70s can find their own struggles in &quot;Chinese Partners&quot;, the 80 back door can find their own love in &quot;To Youth&quot;, why can&#39;t you let the 90s reminisce about their friendship in &quot;Little Times&quot;? ?"
53,"I was anxious to see it. I felt that An Qi was too stupid. She was always hurt by Anna. Also, the story was tragic. The first one was because of the pain of others and the pain of the heart, the crying Anna, and the excellent male actor Chen Xi. Die. However, such a story cannot be separated from two unconventional plots. One is that the person who harms others is not a god who does not know what to do, but someone deliberately connives, and finally is ruthlessly exposed. Second, there must be one and death. The protagonist looks the same or similar. I don&#39;t quite understand why Anna is doing something wrong, but it is doing the same thing as An Qi. Anna is so ignorant that everyone is so good to her, still feel that everyone is cheating on her, even if she knows. It’s strange to blame Hao Xingyu for raising the tiger and to pamper her again and again. In fact, Anna is a real person than anyone else, and people like Angel, do not love themselves, will they really go to love Anna? It’s good to say that it’s kind and selfless. It’s hard to say that it’s screaming and weak, but it’s because there is no such person in reality, it seems to be precious on the silver screen. For the person of Yin Haoming, there must be no reality in reality. The so-called odor is similar. A person will like a vicious person like Anna. It will not be a good thing in itself. It will not be so kind and selfless. People who love will be willing to give everything. However, the screenwriter is a bit well arranged. Anna has a child to understand her mother. Cheng Nai’s choice of Anna and An Qi can understand her father. There are a few points that don&#39;t understand: 1. Lu Manqing is so bad, Song Liyuan still loves her, Anna has done so many bad things, and finally got the love of her mother and daughter, and the fate is too good for them. 2, Anna killed Chen Xi, An Qi still smothered her, this is not fair to the morning, is An Qi only love his bad sister? 3. Song Chenghao finally took Anna as his best friend. Is he stupid? 4, An Qi is too perfect, perfect to be unreal and full of paradoxes and contradictions, she is good for everyone, and finally can not balance, will not summarize themselves? 5, Finally, Hao Xingyu still did not tell Anna that she was the daughter of the murderer. I thought that Anna would still feel that she was false, but she did not. This is not in line with the plot. 6. Why did Lu Manqing not serve her sentence, is she innocent? Although it is a coincidence that there is no such thing as a book, there are too many coincidences in this drama. The dialogue is always heard and the key words remind us of what happened and heard. The latter is especially, is it to lengthen the drama? In addition, the ending is perfect and too fake. It feels that the scriptwriter can&#39;t write it anymore, and it ends like this.Also pay attention to the dubbing, dubbing light, even if the dialogue is dark and violent, the sword will be gentle, but the dialogue is easy, the dubbing is low, and the emotion will be gray. The play is generally very bitter, and the play is as famous."
54,"Coyote Ugly (2000) is a movie that was discovered by chance when searching for songs on the Internet. I found that the heroine is Piper Perabo, which I am familiar with, and I have a good song on the Internet, so I downloaded it and watched it. It’s over. However, after reading it, I was somewhat disappointed. It is not a good-looking movie. The film tells the story of a young girl fighting for her ideals. The heroine who grew up in an American town left her hometown to come to New York to find her dream, becoming a composer. However, there is a huge gap between ideals and reality. The heroine not only can&#39;t send out her own demo, she is also deceived by a boy who works in a restaurant. In order to publish her own songs, the heroine needs to sing her own songs, but she has the same problems as her mother. Therefore, at the time of the stage performance, she fled the market. When the disheartened heroine came home, she found that her room was stolen, and the money was looted, and she suddenly felt that she had nowhere to go. Fortunately, at this time, the heroine learned that a bar needs someone to help, she came to the interview, and the boss agreed to use her after a simple chat. In this way, the heroine became a sexy wine seller in this bar called &quot;Women&#39;s Club.&quot; Although the heroine was not proficient at first, but after a while the heroine adapted, and she can sing here. At the same time, the heroine interacted with the boy who lied to her and quickly became involved. After a while, the boy helped her to contact a performance, but the heroine did not go because of the market, so the two had a big fight, and they broke up, and the heroine was fired because the boy came to the bar to make trouble. Since then, the heroine&#39;s father had a car accident. During the hospital, the father told the story of the heroine&#39;s mother. It turned out that the mother sang. My father told this, I hope that the heroine will not stop. In this way, with the unremitting efforts of the heroine, she got a performance opportunity, friends, fathers, boys all came to see her performance, the girls of the female wolf club and the proprietress who forgive each other with the heroine also came. Finally, although the heroine has a little bit of a market, but when the boy helped to power off, the heroine gave a wonderful performance, she became famous! The film is very inspirational and the theme is correct. It is a thoroughly inspirational film. So the theme of it is not much to say, just to sum up, that is, through the story of the heroine&#39;s hard work, telling the audience that as long as they persist in their ideals, and with the help of friends and relatives, the dream can be realized. Very fairy, very beautiful, very clichéThe Hollywood story is perfect for young people to enjoy. Although the movie is so inspirational, its plot is too bad! It does not conform to reality at all. In the first forty minutes of the movie, the plot is still relatively normal, and most of the rest of the time is illogical. For example, the heroine meets with the boy once or twice, and she has no precautions. The reasons for the bar&#39;s proprietress&#39;s dismissal and leaving the heroine are particularly far-fetched. For example, will the money be used to fight? And the heroine and the boy came to bed too fast, and too active, the heroine has not seen a man? For example, the father did not want to leave the heroine at first, and did not want her to stay after the accident. This change is not in line with common sense. The reconciliation between the heroine and the proprietress is also inexplicable. If you don’t say anything, you will shake hands and talk, when the audience is a fool? These are just a few of them. There are still a lot of them like this, so they are not mentioned one by one. In short, in order to tell an inspirational story, the film has made a lot of unrealistic plots. It is completely &quot;beautiful over the head&quot;, too fake! The filming is quite satisfactory, except that the beautifully cut and dynamic music of the girls is very enjoyable, and other aspects are common. In addition, the style of the film is similar to that of the 1980s movie. The hot dance, inspirational theme, handsome man and prostitute are very nostalgic. At the same time, the old architecture and decorative style in the movie will also make people feel like this. It is hard to believe that this is a movie released in the new century. Finally, the songs in the film are not so good. How can the original soundtrack of the movie be so popular? And Piper Perabo also sang, so I can&#39;t accept it. Not much to say about the actors, they are some second-line actors, only the father&#39;s actor John Goodman is somewhat famous, but also a perennial green leaf. The performances of these actors are consistent with the popularity, and they are ordinary and well-regulated. In fact, the actors&#39; acting skills are useless in this film, because they are the &quot;wolf wolves&quot; who come to sell meat. They have a figure and a face! But I still want to mention Piper Perabo. When she was 24, she didn&#39;t look so young, but she didn&#39;t look old in the American drama &quot;The Secret&quot;. It was an anti-aging woman! It seems that being young and young is not an advantage. in conclusion. This is a fairy tale that is woven by a person who loves to dream. The things happening in the film will be another way in the real world. However, such a movie can still be in a bad mood.At first glance, at least give hope.

55,"Writing a movie critic in the middle of the night is not a good thing, especially when you are hungry. Plus this time is a blind search. The minds are full of good food that Johnston has eaten, and even more hungry. This is clearly the movie of Johnnie To, this is Johnnie To. The other side of the previous Johnnie To film is always so cold, cool this time, the Du Qifeng movie is really a bitter and thrilling. It doesn&#39;t matter, this is the Johnnie To film, which is produced by Galaxy Image."
56,"I am also very surprised why some movies are played in a group of people running out to dance, maybe they think that singing and dancing can express the strongest feelings at the height of the climax. But the downside of this is that it is easy for people to jump, which is equivalent to telling people that these are not true. Therefore, the song and dance drama should be regarded as a relatively small type in the movie. Appreciators must have strong romantic cells, and they will smile at the climax songs and dances. If it is other people, the sensory stimulation brought by this movie It is completely inferior to a hearty martial arts scene, so there is no audience level in this reality-oriented national song and dance drama in China. Any type of film must have its corresponding class and audience. The song and dance drama is obviously some national culture. Develop to a certain degree of results (France), or native hobbies (India). Don&#39;t be starred. The first one is Norton&#39;s deception. He is only the first to play. The main line is still around Woody Allen and Barrymore, and it is obvious that Woody Allen is the old man who uses Norton. He is cute and simple, and Norton’s performance space in this movie is not big."

58,"In fact, I originally wanted to see the movie of Gao Yuanyuan, because I liked her &quot;Search&quot;, I saw it twice in the cinema, and then I found this film. I don&#39;t know where to start, the movie just broke off in 7 minutes, and then I couldn&#39;t find any resources. Later I found out that this was a film banned in the Mainland because &quot;the film&#39;s tone is relatively gray.&quot; Hehe... this will not spit. The title I started was &quot;Seventy-year-old loyalty, love, and car.&quot; The word loyalty used to be youthful, but I feel that I can see youth everywhere, where I advertise my youth, it seems too familiar, change one, then Not too much to try, use loyalty. poor person must have something mean. This is what I think of as the simplest and straightforward description of him. The unkempt face, the black skin, the wooden character, the accent of the ear. From the beginning to the end, there are only cars in his eyes, and sometimes there may be a flash of spring heart. The car was lost, he stayed in the night until the end; he was resigned, he begged the boss to give him another car; went to the car, and was confused and mistaken for stealing a car thief; again and again, but still dead In the car; in the end, he picked up the broken car, as if carrying a broken belief, walking on the streets of Beijing. He is indeed pitiful, but even more sad. Too simple, straightforward, and unspoken, he was hurt in the face of reality. This character of Xiaojian is more in line with the image of the public. In fact, I hated this character at first. I thought it was the car he stole. He also stole the money from the family and went out to play. He didn’t learn nothing. Later, he discovered that he was going to steal the money from the used car. So the first half of the understanding of him is somewhat biased. What makes me most regret and admire is his feelings with Gao Xiaoxiao. When I saw him watching Xiao Xiao sailed to her new boyfriend in the rain, I felt particularly worried. Because I have had this feeling, I can&#39;t help but watch the beloved girl leave. Later, he and Xiao Xiao’s boyfriend were particularly excited in the rain. The man said, “Hey, the car is good.” It feels that Xiao Jian’s blow has been deeply attacked. Sometimes, the rivals may not need such a mother-in-law. If you act as a mover, you will be separated. I think if it is me, it is estimated that I will give up chasing Xiao Xiao, or go to a corner where I sneak a little more directly. But Xiao Jian did not. This is where I admire him. The phrase &quot;fucking your mother&quot; may be impulsive, but very bloody. Later he handed the car toAgui said that when I don&#39;t have to pay back, I feel the chivalrousness of his body. Like many 17-year-old teenagers, he likes vanity and good face, but his heart is not too bad, and his heart is affectionate. Everyone has a few brothers or girlfriends in their seventeen years old. They walked us through high school, walked through the college entrance examination, and then sent us to the university. Some turned and left, and there was no news. Some are still in ours. Mad in youth. The word loyalty is used here to be neutral, because I don&#39;t know how to evaluate Xiaojian&#39;s buddies. Because they all have cars, Xiao Jian was stealing money from the family to buy used cars under the vanity drive; and because of their embarrassment, he chose to go back to Agui to settle accounts, a group of people to bully a person in a foreign land, weak and incompetent. The courier makes people feel a little bit ugly. But at the intersection of the school, they will silently walk away to create opportunities for Xiao Xiao Xiaojian; they will help Xiaojian, even if he knows that the car is not glamorous, he will always stand on his side, &quot;as long as In a word, Xiaojian, let&#39;s go to him. &quot;Although there is a 17-year-old impulse, rebelliousness and vanity are in it, but they do what the brothers should do.&quot; They are more straightforward and warmer than the complex interpersonal relationships that are now intriguing. I have already said a lot in Xiao Jian’s statement. I believe that every boy in adolescence is eager to have a girlfriend like Xiao Xiao. Perhaps some people are more fortunate, they have owned or are in the past; some 17-year-old emotional history is blank like a blank sheet of paper. I just want to say that everyone is not lonely at the age of seventeen. Perhaps it is very difficult for you to spend this time, but after passing, suddenly look back, the seventeen-year-old love will always wander in youth, lingering. It is obvious that this bicycle is the main line of the whole movie, the development of the story, all the plots are centered around this bicycle. For Agui, cycling is his job, reality, his life, his material pursuit; for Xiaojian, cycling is his vanity, a sign of his consistency with his partner, and a source of confidence for his pursuit of his lover. Is his spiritual pillar. On the train, Agui walked to meet the satisfaction, and walked confidently; riding a car, Xiaojian looked calm and confident. Two people of similar age, because of a car, the intersection of life trajectories, and a turning point. Under the oppression of matter, two poor and sad souls and a distorted society are bloody in front of the audience. This is the source of the sadness of the story. In short, this is a very Chinese film, no Hollywood.The special effect lens of the film is just a story that happened in the streets and lanes, and the transmission of thought intentions is more subtle. Everyone who has passed through youth can find his own shadow in more or less."
59,"I always remember that when I saw Chongyi ten years ago, it should be the stage of my lowest valley in my life. I didn’t graduate long ago and I was unemployed and lost my love. I was doing my favorite job, but I was quarreling because I was separated from my lover at that time. Exhausted, often crying and screaming in the office, the craziest one was to take the nearest flight to Guangzhou, but did not explain to the boss. After that, I could only move out of the company dormitory, live back to my own renovated cottage, and huddled in the narrow attic. I still felt shivering on the hot days, and repeatedly watched the rush and the emperor flower over and over again. So even if many fans were sick of Zoe, I still liked her image there, never giving up hope and working hard every day. Directly led me to see Bella, I can not wait to see her can kill her. Naturally, I also liked the four small handsome and Ye Hao&#39;s hard work and progress, eager for the simple happiness of flying into the sky, and so many stories that happened in the airport. In the end, they all ended up happy. Those positive energies inspired me and wiped their tears and looked forward. I know that it’s been two or three years ago to rush to the sequel, and I’ve been looking forward to it. There have been many stories in the past ten years, and I have never lost my life and become a vicissitude. I couldn&#39;t wait to start the drama on the first day, but when I saw Sam&#39;s first sight, I saw the old age spots that he couldn&#39;t cover, and when I couldn&#39;t cover the wrinkles, I almost burst into tears. Just like I have not dared to look in the mirror, especially when I found out that I was born early. The original time is the most irresistible sadness. Perhaps the director chose Lin Zixiang to sing the theme song, which is also the meaning of this. No matter the drama, everyone can&#39;t escape the years, but it is because of the years. . ."
60,"At the time, when the light-killing knife was on Stallone&#39;s face, his neck and the whole body were engraved or deep or shallow, he still picked up the axe lying on the ground and waved at the enemy&#39;s head. Just like thirty-seven years ago, he stood up on the stage with his fists up, full of disdain and pride, when his name was still Rocky. And this workshop filled with iron-like taste is like the smell of the air on the street in the eighties. The color of the muscles is red, the blood in the outline of the fist is bleeding, and the sound of the physical collision is more spectacular than the sound of the collapse of the building. Washing away the image of the lead under the stunt, let the actor return to the ancient and showing the sense of body beauty and power, and the name of &quot;Red Alert Veyron&quot; itself has a simple taste, like a warehouse from the spider web A disc found in . For a long time, as long as it is the movie starring Stallone, we often look at the movie itself, but the hero he spoke for himself. Stout, barbaric, patience, sharp, like a thick steel plate, suppressing all the evils that are attempting to rise. Nowadays, this kind of emotion is still the same. No matter how many times the world was destroyed in the industrial pipeline of Hollywood, how many times the White House was bombed, and how many flying trapeze appeared, he is still a lone walker from the depths of the jungle. He will not save the world and will only save justice. When he appeared on the streets, the steady pace of walking like a cowboy in the west, the melancholy and gloomy eyes clearly surpassed the temperament of pedestrians&#39; fragility, mediocrity and slavery. &quot;Red Alert Veyron&quot; may be his last work, but it is only possible. This tribute to the traditional action film in the name of Stallone is solid, tough, and reveals a black humor. The plot doesn&#39;t have to be thought too much, everything is handed over to bullets and fists. It gives us a sigh, or an incentive: the knife is not easy to rust, and the ginger is still very spicy. The film is designed for Stallone, not evading his old age, nor deliberately concealing his old. Self-deprecating is the best way when the game is in place. When a fascinating detective, Taylor Cowan (Cheng Kang), joked with the girl at the tattoo hall and Stallone, he said, &quot;That is my daughter.&quot; This line is undoubtedly the most humorous part of the whole film. When everyone realizes that a 67-year-old hero can hardly use emotional drama to please the audience, because it looks very fair, then it is not a good thing to turn a man and a woman into a father and a woman. Let the prospective father-in-law and the prospective son-in-law become a pair of &quot;happy family&quot; combination, which is now a fashionable topic. &quot;Red Alert Veyron&quot; does thisThen, in the image of Stallone, the character of &quot;Ginger is still old and spicy&quot; is injected. His ability to see everything and to indicate everything like God has given the detective many unexpected lessons. A killer from the street and many times in prison, the immunity to life and danger is far more than a policeman sitting in the office and only using mobile phones to check information. Here, old and young, trendy and traditional, have changed positions. Agent Taylor understands legal knowledge, knows how to investigate, will use the latest technology, but does not understand what is survival game, how to subdue evil. Stallone used his many years of life and death experience to make the post-life insistence on the principle become unspeakable, realizing the unification of his personality as an old-fashioned star. This is also like the combination of the company commander and the instructor in the Chinese war film. One is rough, one is weak, one is always repeating discipline, and one is always breaking the principle, but in the end, harmony is achieved on the battlefield. In the narrative, &quot;Red Alert Veyron&quot; is a typical &quot;pruning&quot; narrative technique. In order to make the trees grow taller and straighter, the farmers will regularly pruning the branches and cutting off the surrounding branches, leaving only one or two trunks. The same is true of &quot;Red Alert Veyron&quot;. The beginning looks a bit complicated. The police are killed by the killer, the killer is killed by a stranger, the prostitute with a cat pattern is alive, the detective goes to investigate... In a quick clip, a group of characters The fish went on the scene, but the relationship was not clear. But with the development of the story, the people who are not related to the main line are dying quickly, like the leaves, even if the main messenger behind the shady can not be spared. The real contest exists between the two killers belonging to different camps. They are not fighting for money, but for the honor of men. The tough guy from Hawaii Island, Jason Moma is more powerful than Stallone, and has a tough face like Antonio Banderas. His momentum is far behind Stallone, but the final result depends on a bullet. After all, the cold weapon can&#39;t resist the hot weapon, the flesh can&#39;t reach the blade, and the hero can&#39;t resist the time. The only thing he has is the unyielding arrogance."
61,"I have read a report earlier that &quot;the final face of the old season is going to return.&quot; So, in the first episode, we saw Effie. In the fourth quarter, with the one who was badly beaten to death by a bad doctor, his feelings with Effie ended in vain. Unexpectedly, Effie once again appeared, has become a beauty in the workplace. The second episode, with the appearance of Cathy, strengthened the belief of chasing the final season. Because the fifth season saw a few episodes, there is no way to continue, of course, the sixth season is also impossible to talk about. Yes, Cathy in the first and second seasons is one of the female characters I like to watch this drama. If you really want to rank, I am afraid that it is still the first. Kay, who played in the first two seasons, is a little neurotic according to other people in the play. I do not care. I just like it. Unexpectedly, in the second quarter, I went to the United States in the far-off, and the boy who liked her also chased the United States. I sincerely hope that the second episode of the seventh season, Cathy, said to Yanif, &quot;the people who were together in the United States.&quot; It will be the boy. Cathy left after the second season. I didn&#39;t expect to see her again in Game of Thrones. It was an accident. Then it was good to see her again in the second episode of the seventh season of the Skins. The photos taken by Jacob are really beautiful."
62,"How to say it, let me think of the sea flat king, the difference is that the sea flat king is taking the literary youth route, and the super hero is the 2B youth route. Americans like to play a heroism, one person saves one side. Wilson is tall and big, and long is not good-looking, but in the end, the explosiveness is extremely strong, and the acting is another eye-catching. Small lightning, the head is half broken, you think the hero is so good. Allen Peggy grew up and looked much better than before. In fact, this movie reminds me of a passionate version of the superhero. The bad guys always have to be punished. And justice, always standing on the right side, at least this is true. As said, Frank is not a child chosen by God, and Sarah is. Is this also telling us that the poor man can&#39;t help the goddess, the poor boy is at most a spare tire. In fact, what a woman needs is someone who understands her and makes her feel safe. Frank is very poor. In fact, I think he is a good man, but he loves the wrong person. The plot is not too much surprise, a lot of plots, you see what you should do in the front. At most, it is a funny entertainment movie. Give Samsung the head."
63,"When I was a teenager, I lived next to the Hongfa Temple in my hometown. There were also a few well-known monks. So I often entered the hall and the house. When I was hungry, I gave some fruit. I used some vegetarian food to see more martial arts and monk meditation. Over time, there has been some understanding of the Dharma. It is probably summed up. It is a very good thing to believe that Buddhism is a good thing. It can cleanse the inner dust, and forget the fame and fortune. The most different thing is to clear the sense of guilt and let go. The butcher&#39;s knives, the place to become a Buddha, the bandits can be influenced by the Dharma, the compassion of the realm, as vast as the universe. So when I knew that there was a movie like &quot;I don’t want to go to Guanyin&quot; for the Bodhisattva, I couldn’t wait to relive the feelings of my youth. It was as if I was intoxicated, as if I had entered a new world, where I wandered with the legend and listened. Buddhism and Xuanxuan, in addition to the word Zhuji, each color has a deeply comprehensible story setting, incorporating the Dharma into the film, is the most holy film in recent years. Such as the pure beauty Li Chun played the lotus girl, as everyone is like a loved one, even if the enemy, not reading life, not only the heart of the Buddha, but also the beginning of the human nature of the girl, as the rising sun is bright; The monk Huishang, between the cause and the fruit, seeking and getting between the hardships, entangled in the pursuit of Buddha images and neglected the Buddha&#39;s heart, finally got through the hardships after the hardships, passing the lights and the Putuo Dojo, can be described as a generation of masters; The warrior is late, the martyrdom and the righteousness are two difficult choices. The first one is only lost, but it is rare. The last example is the secret color porcelain master Yu Xiufeng. But left the incense to pass on from generation to generation. This is the most flamboyant role in the film, and the light king, such as Nie Yuan, the road of the king, the heavy pursuit, the court murder, the help of the Limei family, is similar to the thirteen sticks to save the Tang The story of Wang added more superficial dramatic points to the film. The most fascinating thing in killing and killing is that he refused to go to Guanyin&#39;s past and present. The story happened in the bloody era of the Wuzong eradication of the Buddha in the Tang Dynasty, but the feeling of giving it to the audience is very beautiful in the thrills? Like the last scene of the film, all the protagonists of the protagonist prayed under the Guanyin, Putuo Mountain has been pulled The vision of the whole earth, the world has become very beautiful. It seems that there is really a Guanyin in the universe? Perhaps it is the lotus girl who shelters us in the distance. It is beautiful now, but we all know that behind every Buddha statue, there are earth-shattering stories, or robberies, or sufferings, or roads, or long-lasting feelings, not tempered, not true.Kim, like Yu Xiufeng&#39;s three generations of single biography, good deeds and good deeds, only burned a secret Guanyin. This kind of history is actually a drop in the story of Buddhism. Only in front of the Buddha statue, you know how small the body and the common customs are. The film related to Buddhism, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to Guanyin&quot;, the connotation or performance is the purest. I can remember the more connotative Japanese &quot;Rashomon&quot;, the &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot; with a wide range of foreign powers, near Perhaps more popular in recent years is &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, and the film that pays tribute to Dharma in the film is too numerous to mention. For example, there are many similarities between the lines and &quot;Don&#39;t go to Guanyin&quot;. &quot;A generation of masters&quot;, this is enough to show that the influence of Buddhism on Asian movies is profound. Unlike some Western films with religious colors, we have religious films in the East that are beautiful and detailed. Although the story is full of disasters or death, the whole is bright and classic, just like &quot;I don&#39;t want to go.&quot; Guanyin When the Guanyin appeared, the rainbow and lotus after the storm. This kind of trait is also a manifestation of values. Love everyone, be kind to life, be kind to yourself. In this increasingly fast-paced era, we all need &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to Guanyin&quot; to do a soul cleanup for myself. May the Dharma protect everyone."
64,"If the speed at which the cherry falls fall is 5 cm per second, how long does it take for the two hearts to get close? Just like Guishu and Mingli, the first love is too sad, and there are too many uncertain factors in love and love. The train that has been sitting for so long is only to see you on the side, there is no mobile phone, but the communication is firmly. And you are at the station at the same place for a whole night. When is there a simple first kiss, then simply no sex spends a warm night, but it is different. Yes, those who haven’t said anything in years are love, just love. Street, platform, road, corner, car door, inside and outside, city, cherry blossom, suburbs, heavy snow. There are also those times on the road, maybe walking, maybe cycling, maybe motorcycles. Anyway, those are the time that two people spent together, even if the other person&#39;s heart is not with you, but perhaps this is the closest distance you have to him. But I think she is not wrong and not stupid. If it is me, I will do the same. Love is not so clear size. Love can not die, death is not love, leaving is not love. The love in Cheng Tian’s heart is forever. Yeah, &quot;Only one side is thinking about the far field, crying, then I fall asleep.&quot; Maybe a lot of times can only be like this. There are too many unspoken years in those years, it’s silly, it’s love. I don&#39;t know what I wrote so much. Stream of consciousness is true and memory. Because they are all love, now, please cherish it. if it is possible. &quot;We are only 13 or 14 years old in our dreams.&quot; &quot;We are all stupid.&quot; &quot;Haha.&quot;"
65,"First of all, the author is not professional at all, the writing is not good, and there are not many movies. The film reviews are purely self-entertainment. Not to mention the plot, &quot;The Promise&quot; is at least uncontroversial in the effect of art. The mirrors, colors, costume design, soundtracks... all have been meticulously crafted, beautiful, a fantasy, fresh, colorful and natural. taste. At the beginning of the city, there was a light yellow shawl with a deep red cloak, blue sky and white clouds, and the breeze was slowly. The Iraqi man stood on the top of the palace with a pair of red makeup. Why did you ask Kunlun to fall in love with her? This is the answer. The two sets of watercolors, flower patterns, pink and yellow robes from the hand of the city are the perfect combination of classical and modern design, light and elegant, and also a kind of elegant and leisurely feeling of seclusion. The pure masters, like the generals, did not appear to be awkward. Instead, in his cynicism, he showed a kind of free and easy disguise that he tried to disguise, away from Wang Chengyu, and fame and fortune. From the time of seclusion with the city, the light has been wearing this robes, which is not a hint of his fate and psychology. The meaning of the flower armor is even more obvious. I really like the name of the flower armor. Flowers seem to be contrary to war and killing. In fact, it is a very poetic softening of the rigidity of men and war. Brilliant red flowers, like the blood of the engulfed in the blade, like the fire of the generals in the hearts of the generals, like the red clouds in the sky when they are victorious, like riding a red carpet over Wangcheng, like everyone admires and The light of envy. However, the flowers are short-lived and perishable. After blooming, they will soon wither and fall, and will eventually be buried by the earth. Just as there are no generals on the battlefield, life will always rise and fall. And Guangming has been unable to see through this point. He will lose too much in success or failure, and he will not find his own destiny. Unlike other films, &quot;The Promise&quot; does not use too many special effects and messy lights to create fantasy, but uses a non-realistic art design to render the whole world. For example, the above-mentioned clothing, there are many scenes and props: the huge golden bird cage designed by Huancheng for the Allure, the simple appearance of the hidden city and the retreat of the generals, and the double-deep thatched house inside. The generals are waiting for the fall of the city. The Begonia flower, the white feather cloak of the Allure, and the black crow cloak of the Ghost Wolf... When it comes to the Promise World, many people may think of the space hole, the plot is simple but inexplicable, the characters are not many, the relationship is chaotic, the background and the times The features are not clearly explained. I want to say about this, firstPromise is not a fantasy movie that is dominated by traditional plots. It is not like the magical, ice and fire of Western fantasy films, with huge scenes, numerous characters, complicated character relationships, tortuous plots and adventures. At the same time, many Western fantasy works are supported by grand original novels. The original authors have already made great efforts, so the three views of these works are of course complete, and the character plot is of course complete and logical. I don&#39;t want to defend some of the lack of logic and the incompleteness of the plot. What I want to say is that &quot;The Promise&quot; is definitely not the way of a mainstream movie. On the contrary, Chen Kaige is almost a sword, he has created a An artistic, purely oriental aesthetic film. A lot of things are freehand, and can be said to be unspeakable, just like the difference between an ink painting and a sketch. But freehand does not mean that it is not good to tell stories. The greatest success of &quot;The Promise&quot; is that it combines stylized aesthetics with the story of the characters perfectly. The film is especially deep in shaping the protagonists, and it has infiltrated many ideas of Eastern philosophy: Destiny, cause and effect, chance coincidence, love and hate, and a thought into a demon, a year into a Buddha... The heroine and the protagonist are similar to the generals, that is, they are all eager for one thing. The generals are eager to win, and the city is the most beautiful woman in the world is part of the fruit of victory, while the city is eager for true love. The irony is that anyone who has too strong desires will be accompanied by fatal weaknesses, so no joy can win every time: he sends soldiers to play a scene in front of the light, and the generals are immersed in flowers. The armor entered the trap of the king city; he weaves the lie and makes the city think that he loves himself, and the city is easy to cast himself. It’s often impossible to get a tight grasp of what I want. I think the meaning of the role of the goddess Chen Hong may be to tell them to let go of their obsessions and not to be concerned about fate. However, this character was not set up, and it appeared inexplicably several times and then disappeared completely. Contrary to them, Kunlun can be said to have no desire, no self, and no loss. He is like a day-to-day Kuafu, or a moth that fights fire. It is simple and firm, and has a clear love. So only he can run freely, beyond the speed of light, through the wall of time. As for the joylessness played by Nicholas Tse, I admit that the bloody case caused by a gimmick is far-fetched, but it is also reasonable. The things that I experienced when I was young have a deep impact on the individual. I am deceived to breed and distrust, and I become a Buddha when I become a Buddha. noHuan no longer believes in others, and does not understand love and being loved. Therefore, he thinks that many people are &quot;ruthless&quot; like him. However, he is wrong. Ghosts are greedy and put on black robes, but eventually they are the same family. Betrayed him and gave birth to death; he thought that the general was willing to sneak and steal, and the light also used his usual awkward, cynical tone to say, &quot;Who is willing to die?&quot;, and the second second of the rope was solved. The general who lost all the time but stabbed him with a sword. The character of Wu Huan is a little touched by me, that is, he is not as inhumane as the villains in many movies. The ghost wolf took off his black robe, and he also let go of Kunlun as promised. Before he swallowed, the so-called man would die and his words were good. He said to the city where he was sitting in the chair. Look at them, they are dying.&quot; In fact, the characters and stories in &quot;The Promise&quot; are very traditional martial arts and landscapes. The dialogue is rare, leaving a lot of white, crisp and neat, morally stunned. In short, &quot;The Promise&quot; is a bold attempt by Chen Kaige, and later &quot;Search&quot; is also, I feel very good in both, the latter is a very explosive one in the same subject. In any case, even if the movie is not pleasing, there is at least no big problem. It’s just that I don’t know why public opinion always pushes his work to the cusp. Although I am only trying to be a non-reliant member of the minority who is not famous, in the words of Guo Jingming, it is a small dust in the vast universe, the existence of small and small. I use the Douban account without a vest to give each non-black, unbiased movie review a useful point, but I believe that thousands of useful together can form a solid top! The value of Kaige and &quot;The Promise&quot; will eventually be recognized by the world."
66,"Before expressing my love for the film, please allow me to spend a minute to spit on the poster of the film: If &quot;Tiantai Love&quot; is unfortunately cold reception box is not satisfactory, then this is full of wash and cut. The poster is the culprit in the murder of the movie. In addition to the lively and crowded typography, the whole message is not exaggerated to say that it is like a big bargain advertisement at the end of the street barber shop in a urban-rural area. Our dear Zhou Dong uses the &quot;prodigal plaster&quot; to wipe. After a cool and arrogant hairstyle, I stood at the door of the store, licking my breasts, and seeing the big abdomen mermaid line. Then I only heard something like an olive in my mouth. &quot;Yo, my hairstyle is four.&quot; Not four??, yo, wash and blow 15 yuan full set?&quot; Originally, the normal film name and posters are so matched with a piece of strong cottage smell, and the face of the roof, &quot;The Rooftop&quot; Translating the name is extremely interesting. I don&#39;t know what you think. Anyway, I personally passed through the roof of the &quot;Hangover 1&quot; in the second pass. Then I will be the brain-filling link of the heart. Of course, this may be just The three views are not right, I am a wishful thinking, the right is a nonsense and nonsense. All in all, the meaning of the expression is very simple. The configuration of such posters and titles is easy to be turned over by passers-by viewers who are not really love powder. Then they may be forced to choose the &quot;Return to Earth&quot; and the same period. &quot;Blind Detective&quot;. Well, it’s roughly the situation. Fortunately, even if there are countless posters and their ill-conceived titles, it is still difficult to hide Jay Chou&#39;s full-fledged and maverick &quot;?&quot; male character. Unlike the &quot;Ting Ling&quot;, &quot;The Big Dunk&quot; and &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; starring Jay before, the work of self-directed self-directed music creation of &quot;Tiantai Love&quot; can be described as playing. Style, play a personality, play a tone, through the miscellaneous, deconstruction and re-creation of the type film, stewed a cylinder called &quot;comedy art love inspirational pseudo-black gang fake car drama songs and dances&quot; experimental nature Summer hodgepodge. Let&#39;s start with a few songs and dances from the film. The first and foremost must be the &quot;Bo Ye Chinese Medicine&quot; song and dance led by Zeng Zhiwei. &quot;跛&quot; - &quot;噎&quot; - &quot;Zong&quot; - &quot;医&quot; When the four words just sounded, I only felt the eardrum itch, then &quot;I don&#39;t know.What does it feel like it is very powerful?&quot; Then when &quot;跛&quot; - &quot;噎&quot; - &quot;Zong&quot; - &quot;医&quot; was repeated three times or more, I began to feel a melody virus similar to Jiangnan Style began to invade me. The cranial nerves, then, like the feeling of Boom Boom Pow in the early years of listening to the black-eyed peas, I was inexplicably trying to nod my head and twisting my neck. I heard that when Zeng Shu sang &quot;The Compendium of Materia Medica has a record&quot;, I once had a kind of I strongly want to bounce off the seat and then jump to the desire of &quot;small zombies and small zombies&quot;, and then &quot;跛&quot; - &quot;噎&quot; - &quot;Zong&quot; - &quot;医&quot; four words accompany my whole view The film process and after I got up and left, I still lingered in my ear in a single sentence. (The last time I listened to Chinese songs, there was such a strong empty ear that goes back to Yang Yulin’s &quot;I want my life&quot;. Interested pros can feel it.) The degree of ghosts of &quot;Bo Ye Chinese Medicine&quot; can be seen from the lyrics of the song &quot;Bo Ye&quot;: Bo Ye Chinese medicine Bo Ye Chinese medicine Bo Ye Chinese medicine Bo Ye Chinese medicine Bo Ye Chinese medicine wave Lord Chinese medicine, you There is no place on the rivers and lakes. I dare to run here. Saye, I will point you a little bit. (I don’t want to eat grapes without vomiting grape skin grapes.) I can order some of your points (I can’t eat grapes without spitting grapes) I will order you a little. Laughing (Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha It’s not a good thing to compare Ke Yourun’s body with the roots...), a big close-up of the chest that gives the side of the week is a little “frightened”, but it’s because of the follow-up “fighting dance” Naughty and funny, watching Mr. Zhou slide and dance, accompanied by the &quot;Rosemary&quot; music, using a combination of Wang Baquan to beat a few lame big men is full of exaggeration and absurdity of performance art, the play is just right The lyrics sung in the mouth, such as &quot;playing your mother (mother!) is not a strong leg, the muscles are big, the boss&quot;, the lyrics of the singer, the singer, the &quot;innocent mother&quot;, the innocent shoes. One on the &quot;I&#39;m not a myth I&#39;m not a myth it is that I can not pick roadside roses&quot; wonderful texture, straight people cheek teeth after listening to? _&gt; ?. set on the roof, at first II want to say that there is a similar feeling of another Utopia &quot;Pig Village&quot; created by &quot;Stars&quot; in &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, but before the two famous Tiantai residents, the song and dance &quot;Tiantai&quot; (before the prodigal son took the heart back) &quot;I, I, I, I am free, I, I, I, I will cook, I know, I, I, I am your dish, who do you say, I am delivering, I am a brick, I am hiding, I am super handsome, we are touching the West all day. &quot;...&quot; and &quot;Big Star&quot; (after the leader returned to the rooftop, &quot;咻 哗咻 哗咻 哗咻 哗 哗 哗 哗 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) 整个 之后The rooftop is like a microcosm of the world. The simple folk customs and harmonious neighborhoods make this place more like a paradise filled with human touch and fireworks. The other songs and dances such as Ke Youlun took the lead in making a song, &quot;Money is hard to earn&quot; (&quot;We go out to fight, in the end is (wei) Shi (xi) (mi)&quot;) and the night market owner&#39;s &quot;Lover Lake Night Market&quot; (&quot; Hahaha, hip-hop, hip-hop, and so on, have little meaning for the promotion of the plot. They are short and succinct but have a miraculous effect. The songs and dances in Chinese movies are like poetry in the examination composition. They are on the fringe of creation. They are not taboos that cannot be touched. They only have small space, high risks and little results. The sword is slanted and goes right. It is the chivalrous grace of the sword and the end of the world, but in most cases, it is the no return of &quot;one lost and one thousand hatred.&quot; Regarding the evaluation of songs and dances in &quot;Love in the Rooftop&quot;, I don&#39;t mean to use &quot;If? Love&quot; to say things like many film critics, but I want to compare it with &quot;Love and Sincerity&quot; and &quot;Magic Odd&quot; that I have seen in recent years. Enchanted and The Muppets are a simple contrast between the three dance dramas. It is also a performance with strong comic style and stage. In contrast, the ancient spirit of &quot;Love in the Rooftop&quot; is not as arrogant as &quot;Love and Honest&quot;; there are ideas, but the way of presenting is not exaggerated. In the comedy attribute, the Tiantai and &quot;Magic Romance&quot; have their own characteristics, but the deep excavation of the two propositions of inspirational and friendship &quot;Tiantai Love&quot; is not as good as &quot;The Pudding Movie&quot;, but because the former is a real person, Need to borrow the image of the puppet, so it has a higher degree of fit with real life, which is called the grounding gas. clothingIt is also a highlight of several song and dance dramas on the rooftop. A large number of candy colors and the mix of wearing, combined with funny choreography and soundtrack, present a colorful visual effect like the rainbow candy advertisement, and also make the roof a Utopia The existence of the style revives the most dazzling summer beach pants style like the &quot;Rio Adventure&quot;, but it is not enough to raise the eye, but the joy is absolute. Then talk about the selection of the film, the alternation of old and new faces is the key to success. Several old bones such as Zeng Zhiwei, Wang Xueqi and Xu Fan are all part of the character with a guest character, but they are not properly watched: Zeng Zhiwei plays the same role as his former role, but In addition to selling at the beginning of the drug, the phrase &quot;Men&#39;s eating a bad bully, the woman&#39;s eating a change of the tyrants. Bully, is the bully on the bed!&quot; Show a little lower limit, the other parts have convergence, &quot;Zeng style nonsense &quot;When you stop, you will receive it; Wang Xueyu will continue to play the advantages of his own strong field and good voice. Lei Geian, who is unsmiling, plays with soy sauce. There are not many plays, but every time he goes on stage, A wonderful tide of men&#39;s dress is still impressive; Xu Fan&#39;s true character in the Obasan, skilled cooking skills and the care of the juniors, especially the soy sauce, was also beaten by the aunt. Ke Youlun&#39;s black wheel and Huang Junlang&#39;s explosion head are also two unforgettable characters. The biggest feeling is fresh and fun. Ke Youlun&#39;s playful black, Huang Junlang&#39;s Q bullets are cute, and the two are placed one by one in the Jay Chou&#39;s prodigal plaster. Their respective highlights SHOW TIME are not in the minority but still well maintained in the green leaves. The role of the role, coupled with the natural weak breath of egg flowers, the brothers suddenly formed a four-person &quot;wolf gang&quot; from the &quot;hangover&quot; proved to be the best lineup of home robbing and selling, and like The &quot;Hangover&quot; series, no matter how the other three performers, finally highlights that Bledley Cooper plays Phil more handsomely. The brothers in &quot;Love in the Rooftop&quot; helped a strong reaction after the chemical reaction, in three pieces. Under the big green leaves, Jay Chou&#39;s safflower is even more vivid. The new woman host Li Xinai is the kind of second-eye beauty. After seeing it for a while, she feels very clean and comfortable. It’s just... just... just how our heart Ai Dajie is from the film Halfway begins like being downThe words of the sweat-like medicine became swallowed and twisted and dragged, and in a twinkling of an eye, from a small sun-baked feathered feather to the height of the power, this incredible rumor is really impressive, and it’s like being in the second place. Looking at the power and a face-to-face Wu Zun + Han Geng combination, it is hard to describe this magical sense of violation. Regarding red hair, there is nothing to say and quote a comment from the bean friend. &quot;Are you a neurotic disease? Why should you give up treatment?&quot; The next step is to avoid the spit before and after the end of the film. &quot;Tiantai Love&quot; belongs to the typical half of the typical performance of nearly 100 minutes, and finally gave a tiger-tailed movie ending in the pit. Jay Chou wants to play too many tricks. It is not enough for the film to be bent on the &quot;drama/love/comedy/song and dance&quot; position. So, in the future of the movie, he added a crime, a gun battle, and a car that he thought was enough. Waiting for the action of the &quot;big&quot; piece of the element, and finally the one-pot scent of the summer smashed into a more dark dish. Here is just a point that I personally care about?? About the red hair to stab Ray&#39;s paragraph! ! ! That&#39;s right! At that time, the atmosphere, the lights, and the music were just right! Then I suddenly felt a shudder in my heart, &quot;Fuck! 丫 丫 是 准备 准备 准备 准备 准备 准备 准备 准备 准备 准备 准备 准备 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆 昆They are all thought of! Jay Chou, are you?!&quot;, then the old man who gave the scene in the &quot;Shameless Bastard&quot; to the fascinating &quot;Un amico&quot; has been played in my ear in advance, then what violence Aesthetics, what Wu Yusen-style bullets and white pigeons fly together with guns and roses are beginning to appear in my mind! ! ! The sly red hair will take out a knife! ! ! Then just like this, I used a knife to wear a thick and thick chair back to force Lei Ge to lead the lunch! ! ! The frustration of this kind of expectation value bursting out of time made me rush to scream at the slogan &quot;Mr. Zhou, I X Your Uncle!&quot; = Let&#39;s not mention the difference between the scene in the theater and the &quot;Shameless Bastard&quot;. It’s just like the heart of the heart after the door is pushed, such as &quot;The original four you!&quot; It’s embarrassing, oh my god, this is stealing the teacher, Fuchun Mountain Residence. Oh, Tian Sunjianjun’s director is already in tears. As for you must ask meWhen I saw the end of the potholes, I felt that I was thinking about how to fight when I was hitting a car. Then I would say that it was like watching Hua Tsai and Yan Dawei finally run the bookshelf on the bookshelf. You can feel it yourself. At the end of the commentary, I will take a few words about the &quot;values&quot; that I like to hear. After &quot;Tiantai Love&quot; came out, everyone was used to comparing it with &quot;Little Age&quot;, comparing Jay Chou with Guo Jingming, and then claiming that this is a great &quot;victory victory!&quot; The imaginary thing of values ​​is still for me. I don’t want to go online to the same line as the People’s Daily, saying, “You can’t unconditionally condone the appearance of “Little Age 2” and “Little Age 3”, and shouted for a short pattern like “Little”. The slogan of &quot;thoughts&quot; gave himself a plaque. However, although it seems to me that &quot;Little Age&quot; is not too bad to be cast aside, but &quot;Little People&quot;, &quot;Little Art&quot;, &quot;Little Happiness&quot;, &quot;Xiao Lizhi&quot;, &quot;Little Warmth&quot; The same routine with the word &quot;small&quot; is obviously more insurance and cumbersome. In contrast, it seems to have a larger pattern, a higher starting point, a stronger tone, and more in line with the so-called &quot;mainstream values&quot;. That&#39;s it. In a word, the song and dance film &quot;Love in the Rooftop&quot;, which is a mix and match theme, is obvious, but I still want to thank Jay Chou, who has a heart and love to build a candy-colored utopia for the audience, just like you were in Qi Lixiang. &quot;The singer in the book,&quot; &quot;very summer feeling.&quot;"
67,"I can&#39;t think of a good title for a while, um. I just watched the 126 episodes of the TV series. Well, there are a few episodes in the middle that may be too boring or missed. Now I still think about the urge to swallow throat. The same pattern as the first part, how to be happy in front of how to have no sense of how to have love to give you all laughter, but the last few episodes must be all your tears. Compared with the first Jin Fan, You Mei and Min Jing, the second part was even more excessive, and Zhixun and Shijing died directly in a car accident. I don&#39;t know why the scriptwriter wants to make this arrangement. Perhaps, as the bedroom chief said, the scriptwriter is too fond of Shijing and decided to become the wish of the whole world in the finale? &quot;Let time be suspended in this second.&quot; I was originally a People with low tears, frankly, the last few episodes of my tears have not stopped. Renna and Guangxun cried at the press conference. Junhe cried on Shijing’s confession, and there was a breakup between Silence and Zhixun... But the most sad thing for me was the friendship between Haley and New Love. I have to say that the two little actors are really good at acting and they are not losing to other adult actors at all. The little girl who played Haili, after checking the information, knows that it is called Chen Zhixi. I have seen her horror film &quot;Ghost Forest&quot; which was played when she was younger. It’s already 14 years old, and the photo has been turned into a slim little lady. From the first episode, I liked Haley very much. Of course, the way she just started arrogant was really offensive, but I saw at a glance that she was just a little fool. Although every day, loudly and singly, Beijing and New Love are big bad guys and poor people, but it does not hinder her feelings for them. Finally, Haley hurried home, unable to find new love everywhere, crying loudly at the empty house, and I really felt bad at that moment. I hope that after many years, their friendship will never fade, and they will continue to go hand in hand. Let me talk about love. Every time I watch a TV series, I will compare my favorite actor in my heart. This part is very strange. At first, I really like Uncle Li Zhixun, a man with a high IQ and a smart and guilty man. It is not difficult for me to understand why Shijing and Silent are falling in love with him because he is kind and he is good to others. A woman is the most unacceptable to others, and he is so good that it is easy to fall. But sometimes I will think, should this kindness be given temperately? In short, I think that when Shijing wants to go abroad, the uncle’s phrase &quot;Don&#39;t go&quot; gives me the feeling of being embarrassed. At least Shijing is also driven by these three words.It’s been a long time. Zheng Junhe, who likes him from the back. He and his silent brotherhood and his attachment to Shijing. Sometimes I think about it, Junhe and Mute a pair, Uncle and Shijing. Or if Shijing can fall in love with Jun He, then everything should be perfect, just why come to an old-fashioned four-corner love. Perhaps this is the tradition of Korean drama. In short, laughter and tears have been settled, and I will not watch this TV show for the time being. I hope that everyone in the heavens of the TV series will be good, and no more accidents will occur."
68,"1 I read a part of it for free on Jingdong last time and I feel very good. After two days of going to the library to borrow a printed version, the evaluation is still very high. 2 The comparison with Wang Shi’s self-report is that Wang Shi’s self-report is relatively relaxed and slightly proud. Yu Minhong is more worried about his lungs, more like exploring. Wang Shi did a very good job, and Yu Minhong thought a lot. 3 Yu Minhong is a person who loves to read, and his reading is amazing."
69,"Before the &quot;To Youth&quot; hot, moths and fires, after the &quot;Partner&quot; ignorant, full of chicken blood friendship, &quot;Pen Xian 2&quot; stepping on the tail of youth, stunned, draped in a thick The thick and sweet smell of blood clothes, looking up at the immature but a look of miserable smiles, not understated, not revealing the shackles that have been hidden for a long time, far away is the old friends who are familiar with you and me. Friends, when they came closer, they saw the cruel youth that could not be picked up in the place. You and I have Xiao Ai around us, who are enemies and friends. She or the outside school turns to the beautiful and swaying shift students, or the new friends who rush into the small group, or just the edge of the window that is not so lonely. The goodness and evil of youth come suddenly and without traces. The friendship between girls is difficult to be pure. From beginning to end, they share the secrets of each other with intimacy and indifference, but they hate each other with a high or low score. You can&#39;t decide a dead war, don&#39;t admit it, you have to face the evil in your heart, just like the one that has been circulating for a long time. Being chosen as a bridesmaid is never the best girlfriend, but it is not as good as the bride&#39;s girlfriend. Xiao Ai in &quot;Pen Xian 2&quot; is like this. It has a beautiful appearance and a seemingly arrogant character. It does not know how to refuse and cater to the relationship with people. It happens to be as ignorant and savage as you and I. Hu Peng friends, she can only become a victim of young ignorance, the beginning of the human nature, when you were young, have you ever hurt a futuristic classmate, with a scornful disdain, just for the superiority that will not be a reason Maximize the display, do not do the heavy taste of collective murder, but also have the ugly taste of gang violence. After many years, I recalled that the mistakes made at that time were enough to solidify this resentment and solidify to the shadows of Xiao Ai, who is close to us. Regardless of the mastermind or the accomplice, whoever gathered together for many years, whoever inadvertently mentions that darkness is uneasy, and the banter on the mouth can&#39;t cover up the inner panic. If at the beginning of the story, we all bravely extended a warm hand to Xiao Ai, the ending will inevitably be rewritten, and you and I will not be transformed into a silhouette of the end of the film. Of course, the bright spot is that it takes a lot of courage and luck to shoot a thriller in the country. You have to avoid all the crabs. When the audience is tight and extreme, the abrupt and arrogant blend of positive energy and no singing is like no. The existence of love, and the use of this cup of water mixed with wine, confuse the public also anesthetize their own fake high, in order to safely cross the threshold of the mysterious speculation of the relevant departments, so all fear must be orDreams, or schizophrenia, or fantasy can be based on the dragons. Leading to the domestic thriller is to pursue a surge of adrenaline and then smile at the protagonist&#39;s innocent face, completely disregarding the previous ridiculous how to explain reasonably, with this kind of aesthetic fatigue into the theater, but in At the end of the pen fairy 2, she was shocked by a cold sweat. She did not wear a black dress for her. She was full of empty standard ghosts, and she did not make any cover-ups and hints on the screen. Chinese movies can have Ghost? ! Therefore, &quot;Pen Xian 2&quot; is not only a chance to chill in the sticky summer, not just a big screen with a chest plate rolling enough information, but the closed censorship door was finally knocked out. A little bit of light through the door. In addition, if I didn&#39;t go wrong, the other hidden main line of the film is to support comrades in anti-discrimination."
70,"Devil, why is it a devil, it is the human heart that is invaded by the devil, we have to remove its magic, leaving its goodness. Everyone is a Buddha and Bodhisattva in the future. It is just that the opportunity is not here, the magic barrier is clear, and the mind cannot be seen clearly. Chen Xuanzang: Master, I don&#39;t know anything, is it that you are looking for the wrong person? . . Chen Xuanzang, willing to do all evil, willing to do all good, live in the present, no big compassion, great compassion, compassion for the world, save the people who can be saved. Master, you are not so good, you are in violation of the rules. I don&#39;t have goose legs in my heart, and it doesn&#39;t matter if I eat it. You want to eat in your heart, but you can&#39;t eat it on your mouth, it&#39;s a little bit worse. Satay became a fish demon, because he saved a child and was misunderstood and killed, and breeds resentment; the pig is a pig demon, it is a hate because of love; Sun Wukong becomes a monkey demon because it is too much to pursue freedom. Without rules, it is very popular. When the world is in love, when is the time to report, the bitter sea is boundlessly turned back to the shore, one turned to be a Buddha and Bodhisattva, and there is no Amitabha in the south. Chen Xuanzhen has always said that he lives for great love. He really knows what big love is. When a person sees the light, it does not mean that he can use light as an excuse, but face the reality he can recognize. The so-called head does not understand the heart, then do not know how to use it as an excuse. Before you understand, you have the reality that you need to transcend; wait until you understand, and move on to the next step. Shu Qi said, I have a small ideal, you can find a wishful Lang Jun, organize a family with him to have a baby, and then you can live a simple life. &quot;Being a simple life, living an ordinary life&quot; has become the slogan of many people today, but I really understand what is simple and what is ordinary. When a person utters such a thing, there is already an ordinary and extraordinary distinction, and this is no different from pursuing an extraordinary life. Shu Qi tore off Chen Xuan’s three hundred children’s songs, which has an epoch-making meaning. Love, what is it; truth, what is it. Shu Qi snuggled in the arms of the empty son, observing Chen Xuanzhen&#39;s reaction, Chen Xuanzhen went away. If you can choose, you choose a glacier or a river to melt your heart, the world says you are stupid, the glacier will only make you freeze into ice! However, glaciers can also be turned into water, melting everything. Mirrors and waters, the world is like a dream bubble, such as dew is also like electricity. The trouble is Bodhi, who said that he could not find Sun Wukong, far away in front of the sky. Sun Wukong said, you are saying that I have not really realized it. Chen Xuanyuan said, don&#39;t get caught up in these things, as long as you are bent on being good, you will have something to gain. Do you have a desire for enlightenment?Nothing is realized. Very interesting picture, under the moon, Shu Qi is dancing, Chen Xuanzhen is rocking, pig is stabbing, and Sun Wukong is waiting. Four people, four realms. These four realms are untranslatable, and when they are spoken, they will become forms. It is no longer a realm. Chen Xuanzhao: I don&#39;t love you, I don&#39;t want to tie you up. I can&#39;t pick this ring, I don&#39;t want this finger. The so-called love, sometimes cherish, do not pretend not; no time, no longer nostalgia. I want to eat on my mouth, but I don’t admit it. Chen Xuanzhen is a little bit worse. To be detached, it is not the form that is learned, but the essence of the heart. Sun Wukong was born, Chen Xuanyuan said, you just walked out of the cave, the Buddha is still there. Perseverance, still obsessed? The reason why people are suffering is because of the pursuit of the wrong things. Chen Xuanzang always refuses to say &quot;I love you&quot;. The essence of escaping is that you escape the word &quot;love&quot; and say that you love big, but you can&#39;t even say a word of love. Big love is just a form, and little love is still in your heart. To love now, live in the present. Since you meet, don&#39;t ask if it is a robbery. Chen Xuanzhao refused such an encounter. He thought in his heart that he would like to be a Buddha to be a Buddha, and to regard the relationship between women and women as a barrier to becoming a Buddha. However, at the moment of emotion, it is already unclear whether this is a robbery or a fate. We must face up to all our escaping, because we will come back sooner or later. It’s still coming, hiding is not hiding, the problem is how to deal with it. Sun Wukong said, you see that there is no hair left for your most beloved woman, what can your Buddha do for you; you can’t live now, what can your Buddha do for you. The film echoes at the beginning and end. What can the children&#39;s songs say? What is the magical goodness? Master, are you looking for the wrong person? What do people insist on in their lifetime, how many countercurrents can prevent you from letting go of your beliefs, and how many beliefs can make a person strong. Perseverance and dependence make a person vulnerable. No desire is just right, the world is really a small love, not really affectionate. The ruthlessness is true, and the Pure Land world is truly affectionate. Buddha, indeed, can not help people to do anything; Buddha, just tells the true meaning of our life, what is true affection, what is real ruthless. Power and cruelty can&#39;t beat justice. Truth, goodness and beauty have transcended understanding of time and space. The love of all beings is love, no size, no pain, only to know the pain of all beings; have been persistent, can put down the attachment; have been concerned, no concern. Chen Xuanzhen completed the transition from brain understanding to heart understanding. ChenXuanzang believes that the law of salvation is in the Mahayana Buddhist scriptures of Tianzhu. However, this is only a process. The scriptures are not the result of the process. Even this scripture is part of the process. The result is in the present, the cause and effect are constantly being destroyed, the moment is the cause, and the moment is the fruit. All the moments are there, and the power that is there is now, and the Vajray Buddha, who is not immortal."
71,"There is a section in &quot;Aha, Haring, A Movement&quot; that there was a person named Pascal (the Pascal, who is right), raised a question. If a person has no idea for faith or not, he thinks the Bible may be right. It may be wrong, what should he do? In this case, calculate the expectations a little, and everyone will know that religion is a stable and profitable business. Anyone who has no idea will believe. Why is this not the case? Because not everyone in this world treats Christianity with a 50/50 probability. And this book goes on to explain that Pascal&#39;s problem can also be classified as a sub-question called &quot;The principle of Indifference&quot;. The French mathematician Laplace (which is the one that Lapla is unfolding) has proved that treating the problem with a completely indifferent attitude can lead to ridiculous results. There is one more thing to talk about the issue of indication: After the case of George Zimmerman was judged, many people screamed and racist, and it didn&#39;t make sense. After reading all the testimonies of wikipedia, the evidence of murder is not so full. Zimmerman should have no problem with the gun opened after being beaten. Is he really innocent? Not necessarily. Take the initiative to go to the trail to provoke a person who is taller than you, and you obviously can&#39;t beat it. Isn&#39;t that the murderous heart? Therefore, this case is ultimately a problem of prohibiting guns. I originally thought that we don’t have a gun, and we can’t help but shut me down. But after this matter, I thought it was wrong, because first, insisting on not holding a gun is a purpose of goodwill, which is equivalent to making a promise that I will not hurt others. For the ban on guns may hold an indifferent attitude. Second, the purpose of insisting on the looting of people can not be said. But no matter what good or bad motivation, they will work hard to oppose the ban on guns to retain their right to hold guns. In this way, in a democratic society, the result must be that the guns can&#39;t be banned, so the kind people will still not hold the guns. The guns on the streets are all unidentified people. The things of Trayvon Martin may happen in any It’s terrible for people. So my current point of view is that as long as you don&#39;t want to hold a gun, you should have a clear-cut support for the ban. It is not advisable to be indifferent to this attitude. I used to treat it as indifferent.Christian. Until one day, after a regular meeting, a well-connected colleague Sharon said, let me take a walk, and then sincerely and peacefully gave me an hour of teaching from theory to example, I only Really started to worry. Because I know that she is not right, I believe that there is truth in the world, they must not stand on the side of the New Testament Old Testament. However, there are still so many people who feel that they have been educated very well and believe that it is not the truth. I think this is not right. What can be annoying is that I can&#39;t be as powerful as anti-teaching. So I rushed home to gxj嚷, student classmates, recommend a book on modern evolution that science popularizes. Gxj said, look at why evolution is true, well written. That&#39;s right, who will teach me next time, just drop the book out and read it again. A renewed view of creationism is: You see that all the wonderful people are so smart, how could this be randomly evolved? This sentence is wrong in two places: First, evolution is not random, it is naturally chosen. Everything is reasonable. Every creature in the world is eliminated because of some degree of advantage. Second, the exquisiteness of all things is subtle, but because of the traces of evolution, useless or even redundant structures abound in animals and even humans. If there is a creator, he must be a bad designer. There are many other points commonly used by the preachers. Anyone who violates the theory of evolution, this book gives a powerful rebuttal. Of course, you have to say that God has buried a lot of fossils in different geological ages. You insist that God makes reptiles and birds have similar anatomical structures. It is said that God has let this species become extinct and that species has arisen. It also allows some synergistic evolution, while others maintain an ecological balance. I can only say, huh, God, are you not a lover, do not play with such people. Well, in the long run, religion is declining. There was a news before that Israel had a law. Extreme religious elements had the right to exempt from military service and had just been canceled. And same-sex marriage is also legal. Sometimes the Bible version of Mizuki will have some very prominent posts. One of them said this: The Old Testament said that some people carried a beautiful god on Mount Sinai to sacrifice to the Lord. One of the people who carried the cabinet looked at the sacrifice to drop the sacrifice, and the other quickly went to help. God killed him because he was not enough for the Lord.Have confidence. That is why, for example, why do my people still be alive and typing, because God does not exist, and the card must be. But there are still some things that can&#39;t be said clearly. At the end of Sharon&#39;s mission, I asked her: &quot;Do you believe in science?&quot; (Nima, you can&#39;t say no to phd) I asked: &quot;What about scientific examples?&quot; &quot;I said: &quot;For example, light is not disturbed and travels in a straight line. The sum of the two sides of the triangle is greater than the third.&quot; She thought for a moment: &quot;I believe in science, but I also believe that miracles will happen.&quot; I also believe in miracles. It happened. Pie is an infinite loop. It is a miracle. Many laws and conjectures of physics and mathematics are miracles. It may be really god-like, but it may only be that the gas constant is 8.314, and the speed of light is 3x10^9 m/s. It is true that evolution is true. It’s not that there’s nothing to sin and sin, and I’m always cursing the gods who don’t believe him."
72,"The strong time is strong, the weak time is weak, and the strength is very good. Finally, watching the little girl flying a kite on the beach is quite touching. Both husband and wife are yearning for this free, happy and happy life. Just like the name fireworks, a family of three looks at the beautiful fireworks in the air. This kind of life is so dazzling, so people are yearning for it, but it is so fleeting that people can&#39;t catch it. I feel that Hayao Miyazaki is also good for Kitano, and Japanese film directors have a way of thinking about where people are in the environment."
73,"A flash in my mind: In the end, it must not be the end, the female pig&#39;s foot, this is the old lover of the past! Then, what did I see! The old photo turned into a three-dimensional, an airplane head turned around?? Nima is Jay Chou! Nima&#39;s film is played by Jay! Nima is not soy sauce! Nima is the director of Jay Chou! Nimani Manima! I watched the opening of the bowling ball in the mess, and the fluctuations in my heart were like bowling balls falling into the ditch, and I went down all the way to the liao. . . Then the Chinese medicine museum fell and beat the songs and dances and scared me. This arrangement is really new and bold! The single MV will definitely be on the list! A group of pointed chin round glasses dry figure Tutor wheelchair wretched male and ultra short cheongsam old Shanghai big wave dance girl combination visual shock Nima is a goosebump! But the Nima song is very cute! Then on the film, very cute, and a few European and American fairy tale animation story style is very similar, layered paper art animation, colorful, after reading the film will find that the elements appearing in the film have physical props scenes in the film, no matter Some old-fashioned furniture ornaments, the little swan pedal boat, or the sun-shaped glittering dusk studio door, the piece of paper debuted and retired are designed to be very delicate, this title is praised. Then I smoothly entered the rhythm of the Indian song and dance drama and walked for a while, making people feel that they must move with the melody and toes. However, no matter what era of Taiwan, involving the old Taiwanese style, those elements are listed, it gives people the feeling: ah! Nima is good for the show! The bathing soundtrack is still a Japanese song... Whether you add Swan Lake music behind you, the Gaoshan bamboo dance mix and match the Irish circle dance kick rhythm, all cover this strong Showa style! Although there are many dramas of the Showa style in Japan, apart from the classics of the &quot;Showa Songs and Complete Works&quot;, I rarely see this feeling. It really is Taiwan! The scene setting is very heart-warming, and in the &quot;Magic Moment&quot; of Sanki Yuki in 2008, there is a circle around the ground, a small group of people, a fairy tale. It should be such a happy ending at the beginning of this joy, male? Silk defeated the murderous red hair, and drove away the scum male Gao Fushuai, holding the swan goddess return, let the joy song and dance drama come to a successful conclusion. Song and dance to the last moment of the film, any song and dance in the film can record MV independently, the classic songs are sold out, the goddess star show, the Zhou Dong ticket advances, continue the production of the next dream movie, love Basketball to play slam dunk, love racing to play drift, love Kung Fu to play with fists, love what to shoot, this is quite perfect! The film is also very beautiful! Nima transformed for the back of the hair, all the way to blackIn the end, it has developed to the Shaw movie line! The diligently collected red hair was abandoned by the master and the temperament changed greatly. From the knives pulling the pistol to the road pursuit, Nima did not have &quot;ah! Wait, let me sing a song before death&quot;! Showa style! Bathhouse! Old lifts too! Fancy motorcycles! Dance girls! Red hair! You turned off the style of the whole movie! For Mao you don’t sing and dance together! Are you transferring from another film through an electrical outlet like in Invincible Destruction? In fact, I can&#39;t blame the red hair. When the round head of the film turned around, I understood that the second half of the murder was completely paving the way for the appearance of Jiang Dawei! Sure enough, I don’t think I’m like Jay Chou when I was young! Jay Chou thinks so too! Di Jiang series has been crazy for so long, you told me how I forgot the face of Jiang Dawei when he was young! This face is in a mess, I suddenly thought, the black wheel looks like, the oily face, ask, are you my brother! Nima I was passively replaced in the moment, although Dillon is much more handsome, many, many, many more than him! This younger sister is a goddess! Very suitable for the goddess in the Showa style. It’s also a goddess, and it’s still calm in the prodigal plaster Valentine’s Day. It’s not so rushing to put Zhou Dong’s father in the house, but to keep the perfect smile and tears in my heart. I can’t help but sigh, really the goddess what! Athena, who is not confused, but also has a haircut! The moment when the image of the goddess is shattered, it is not the other place, there is only one place, it is insignificant, but it is not tolerable for me! The so-called goddess should be as soft as a hand, such as gelatin, even if the bones are not clear, but if there is no bone, there is a requirement, be slim! Nima recording studio that a pair of white fat fat short as a sacred thing stretched out to cover the earphones for ecstasy input, I disillusioned otz... hand swelling can not afford! Goddess, you have frostbite and your hands are white! ! ? ? Going back to the topic, to sum up, the first half of the film gives 5 stars, and the red hair turns to 1 star."
74,"The first time I watched this movie, I saw the first part. I suddenly found the article and the white lily in the link on a website. I was still immersed in the performance of two people in &quot;Thirty-three days of lovelorn&quot;. Infinitely missed, suddenly saw this micro-movie, I feel that this first part is really good, from scriptwriting, production, to the performance of the actors, plus the final music is very praise. Searching online for all the information about the film found that the original microfilm was the first part of the big movie. Suddenly, the patience has finished watching the whole movie. I have to say that one and a half hours is obviously superfluous for such a movie. The information of the search director found that the director who has taken this for more than ten years is still stubbornly trying to put together one after another mv rearrangement. On the big screen. I didn&#39;t watch the movie in the theater, and I don&#39;t know if those people who watched the movie in the cinema left the cinema when there was a feeling of going home. It must be said that some movies can only be seen in the cinema, and those visual effects and sound effects are only reflected in the cinema. But some movies can only be worn in front of the computer for a while, and it will be redundant in a little more. And spending money in the cinema will definitely make you feel that you are not worth the candle. &quot;Gravity&quot; is a movie that can only be watched at home with a lover. Because there is no point in the urine, there is no bright spot. The story is in a calm stream. The director speaks quietly. We listen to the patience and wait for us. When I am tired of this story, it doesn&#39;t matter, we change a channel, so there is another story, another bunch of new actors, and a new scene, to ensure that it is not repeated. This way to make a movie is obviously quite easy for a director who has taken a decade of advertising and mv. Moreover, with more funds, more red actors, the director is more comfortable with the basic skills. This will definitely not be a bad movie, but it is definitely not a good movie. The film itself is storytelling, using its time and limited time to surprise people. If Zhao’s work is broken into one small movie after another, it should be said to be amazing, but in turn, it is obviously a headache for a bunch of small movies to be put together into a big movie. Therefore, Zhao also handed in a qualified homework, but did not break through the surprises."
75,"This should be the first real microfilm I have seen, so I would like to thank here for such a microfilm that Sina Weibo recommended to me. Now that 2012 has passed, I can finally say that this is the best microfilm of 2012 I have seen. So what is a micro-movie, has anyone given a definition of a micro-movie or a specific direction of guidance, how much time is required for a micro-movie, and what kind of story frame structure is required. Therefore, under this rule system, which is not perfect in itself, the early Chinese microfilms actually took the real advertisement in the real sense in the name of microfilm, and because of the limitations of microfilm, on the one hand, the director of the microfilm wanted To tell a story of oneself, but due to its own conditions, a variety of restrictions on shooting factors (finance is an important reason), so in the process of looking for investors, advertising is the most simple and The simple way to get investment, but the problem is that the director has to change his script and plot according to the requirements and settings of the investor to meet the needs of the investor. The final result of this vicious circle is that the more More ads and fewer microfilms. But fortunately these are my later discoveries. For the first microfilm I saw, the &quot;Tuner&quot; brought me more surprises than expected. This is itself an imaginative film, and the narration of the opening montage brings the basic tone to the whole film. The story is full, and as a micro-movie, it also reflects its unique qualities and the superior conditions that can not be possessed by large screen movies, that is, the short and precise of the story. The director does not need to lengthen the popular stories, but to consolidate his own language step by step, edit his own story, and let the character fully expand in a very short period of time. The final conflict is even more It is obvious. So the thinking brought by such a microfilm is more universal and philosophical. We don’t know what the ending will be like, just like we don’t know what happened in the family. We also don’t know how the tuner walks. Everything in the family has seen those subtle scenes. It seems that the end of the story is not important. We can’t think of others. In the end, we just think of ourselves. If we think of sitting in that place, will we be motionless. Play one song after another."
76,"I just started to say that the training depends on this film. I don’t want it, but after seeing it, it’s not too bad. In general, it’s a part of the inspirational film. I like Ling Min’s decisiveness and calmness. The memory is profound. When someone questioned: Are you sure that Germany will cooperate with us? He has never been there. If he does not become, he will only return to zero. If he is a comfortable person, he should choose a good way to go, but he chooses a road that no one dares to go. I remember that Ling Min said to him about China: When you shouldn’t be fast, it’s a mistake. If you are not happy, it’s a mistake. When the policy is clear, everyone is coming up, the risk is gone, and the opportunity is gone. . This sentence can be seen as an entrepreneur&#39;s vision, and managers with long-term vision and market sense can make long-term decisions. Get rid of the refrigerator to wake up the quality, I think that scene is really quite touching, &quot;we are a little bit worse&quot; can often be a little bit, so we missed the best reason. This is why domestic companies do not live for a long time. If we change a little bit, this will be the guarantee of the most powerful funds. Throughout the story, I feel that I have expressed a lot of things about the manager&#39;s attitude. Although inspirational, this boss is really high-quality in my heart. It seems that I have encountered something, and it feels like it didn&#39;t happen. It makes me feel a little fake... ...but I saw AE, I was quite happy with the dejected ghost. I think President Roosevelt’s words are super good: we have never been so awake as we are now, the only thing we are afraid of is ourselves."
77,"In some ways, the last second move will inevitably result in the next second. This from the first second of the beginning to the countless last second in the middle will eventually result in the last second. We all want to change the last second for the best result. . As everyone knows, life is actually a process of making up for regrets. . This second is your choice. In addition, the end of the two people passed by and felt very deep, as if they had met each other, but everything was passed by. Just like how the butterfly flies, it also flies to the sea. . It is possible that you and her have many common memories, but because of a certain node in the middle, you can no longer go together until it is a stranger. ."
78,"Most movies sometimes insert one or two songs and dances into the clips as an accessory to adjust the atmosphere and increase the enjoyability. In addition to the Indian film exception, the plot in the film as an auxiliary material, a large section of song and dance became the main material. This film is an example. We need to adjust the mentality in reverse before watching the film. We are watching the song and dance, and watch the story by the way. But this is not to say that the plot is nothing, although it is sometimes too dramatic, but it is absolutely unexpected. With a relaxed mood, come to a thrilling experience! When a pair of half-brothers for the 200 million family, playing a variety of suspense and decryption blinds, the intimate brothers instantly turn against the enemy, the first to die and then the counterattack, the road height of one foot magic height of one foot has been People are dazzled by their eyes. After interspersed with two beautiful women, such as Miss World, they turned the four-person emotional road arrangement into a variety of ways. One is a secretary, the other is a wife, and the other is an undercover woman. I kissed me and my brother at the same time. In short, it was difficult to recognize the true identity and true feelings of the last second. After the gorgeous MTV-style song and dance, add some adrenal glanding thrilling bridges, let the audience directly reach the boiling point, you said that this is not fun."
79,"In general, I rarely write Hollywood popcorn movies and animated film reviews, because the routines of these two types of movies can be estimated in advance, and there is nothing to write. The former sees the action scenes enough to be hot enough. The latter sees that there are not enough jokes. On this basis, some mainstream values ​​are added to sublimate. Even if the task is completed well, it will make people feel resentful. The last animated film that I liked so much is &quot;Robot Warrior&quot;. The difference is that &quot;Robot Warrior&quot; wins by romantic and delicate literary temperament, while &quot;Crazy Primitives&quot; wins the extraordinary imagination. From the story, this kind of animated film will follow the path of all ages, so the plot will inevitably belong to the old routine, and everyone can basically guess what the end is. But the same story, different people, the degree of attraction is very different. First of all, the spectacle of the whole movie is really amazing, this is the level of animated film, completely compete with &quot;Avatar&quot;! In addition, what is even more impressive is the emergence of a variety of cute animals, seemingly acquainted and plausible, fully demonstrating what is called imagination without limits. What is even more commendable is that the shaping of these creatures is not completely limited to the eyes of bloggers. Their habit characteristics are also fully utilized at the end of the film, which is logically convincing. After reading &quot;Crazy Primitives&quot;, I can&#39;t help but sigh that the gap between Chinese movies and Hollywood is really not about money or technology, but about imagination. As the film says, don&#39;t be dark, but pursue the light. We don&#39;t know what the opposite of darkness is, maybe nothing, maybe it&#39;s too risky, but only if we have the courage to break through the limits we set ourselves, we can find the light and find tomorrow. Whether it is our own, or our film industry, it should be like this!"
80,"From the beginning of the dancer, I know that it is an acquaintance movie. Of course, the acquaintances here refer to those that are often seen on TV. There is a feeling of crazy guessing. Natto is a small sample, the movie screen is cute and colorful. The props are powerful. The beauty of the rooftop, I really want to live there. When did Ke Youlun take the little handsome route. . The face of the bullet soy sauce is not clear. Although the Tiantai group dance is not very neat, it feels very real. It seems that it is really the neighbor next door.

Hey, how does Natto feel the sense of sight of Zeng Zhiwei’s son? . Aken&#39;s expression of dancing is ridiculous, and the heroine&#39;s lines are inferior. Hey super? Every hair band of Columbia is very good. I don’t appreciate the song of my brother, but his movie is not bad. The secret story that can’t be said is better. There are too many characters in the rooftop, but the heroine is beautiful, it seems to be missing. The development of the plot is really love on the roof, always talking about love. . The plot is a bit old-fashioned. The red hair is swept away by a little stimulation! ? Hey, the gunshot is super?, direct headshot~! Inexplicably began to chase the speed car, I do not know that I thought it was a bit of speed and passion. Songs and dances, unconsciously developed into a speeding gun battle, super?

81,"As Huayi participated in the investment, &quot;Da Ming Tang&quot; was able to &quot;pre-synchronize&quot; in the mainland and enjoy the golden time of the summer file. In the past, the Korean film was either trapped in the quota limit, or changed its face to a new name. The schedule was delayed and delayed, and the box office was not good. This time, &quot;Da Ming Xiao&quot; brought a 3D blockbuster attack, and Huayi worked hard together to see that it was necessary to create a record. The interesting thing is that even with Huayi Capital and Xu Jiao, &quot;Da Ming Xiao&quot; is still a standard Korean special effects blockbuster. Some people can&#39;t help but worry about whether such a story will be unacceptable in China. However, as far as the content of the film is concerned, the existence of Xu Jiao and the Chinese element seems to be “unacceptable”. Considering that &quot;Da Ming Gorilla&quot; is a comedy movie adapted from a comic book, the character plot is somewhat exaggerated and it is acceptable. Going to Korea to send a paragraph, the orphans chasing behind, leading the cry and shouting: don&#39;t come back without earning money. The audience burst into laughter, similar to the passage, and there are many in the film. Either it is strange humor, or it is too hard lyrics, it is not good. However, if we think that the Korean film has a bias toward China&#39;s imagination, then it is not necessary. For example, the description of Yanbian Prefecture, in the pursuit of realistic &quot;Yellow Sea&quot;, the Korean film is very well presented (and these are just missing in the mainland cinema). On the megatrend, &quot;Da Ming Xiao&quot; continued the Hollywood production trend of &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Rise of the Orbs&quot;, focusing on CGI special effects, using dynamic capture. As we all know, Korean movies have risen since the last century. They have always used Hollywood as a template, and they have to make large-scale productions. Today, a group of directors such as Feng Junyi went to Europe and the United States to shoot, and another group of directors like Jiang Digui tried to enter China. This includes the director Jin Ronghua of Daming Gorilla. For Korean movies, the huge size of the mainland market is enough to make every filmmaker who has pursued a heart. Cooperating with Huayi, it is the stepping stone of Korean movies, and directly has the qualification to participate in competition. The 3D effect of &quot;Da Ming Xiao&quot; is far from the Chinese film in Hong Kong or the Mainland. The orangutan spirit climbed to the ceiling of the stadium and was intercepted by a helicopter. Because the film used full 3D shooting, the feeling of climbing and leaping was thrilling. On the close-up of the expressions that are prone to distortion, the film has no intentional Tibetan mastiffs. The scenes of several close-range exchanges are quite excellent, and the spirits and demeanor are all true. It can be said that technically, &quot;Da Ming Xiao&quot; has no obvious problems. In the story, I don’t know whether it’s the original comics or the shooting.As a result of the request, &quot;Da Ming Xiao&quot; constantly reduced the body size? It fell to the point where it is suitable for the family to watch and attract children&#39;s audience, simple and popular. The film story revolves around the emotions of Zhao Weiwei and Lingling. However, even if there are 512 Savior&#39;s live TV broadcasts, some girls finally admit that emotional communication with animals does not exist. No matter how touching or cruel, &quot;Da Ming Xiao&quot; is not surprising. The tone of the comedy determines that it can&#39;t go further, and it also causes the film to be far less like a Hollywood movie in the script (for example, &quot;Rise of the Orbs&quot;). This story has no room for recollection. There is no open blank or even a sequel to shooting. It naturally does not make the audience feel hard to think, but enjoys the baseball that is rushing and whistling. For the Chinese audience, they still have a congenital deficiency when watching &quot;Da Ming Xiao&quot;. For baseball games, they don’t know anything, not even onlookers. If you don&#39;t know the progress of the baseball game, then the suspense and fun around the upper base have been directly deprived, and the rest, only the spirits swing again and again. Even with the addition of a gorilla thunder that only throws the ball, the movie lacks suspense. Generally speaking, the theme of the film around humans and animals, the conflicts that constitute conflicts are either the pressure of social civilization or the threat of another animal. It can only be said that in order to make the spirits anecdote, in order to let the Thunder appear, the film selection is not very clever. Therefore, there are only 3D orangutans around the selling point of Daming. The pursuit of reality in 3D movies is higher than reality, and at the same time it must be &quot;reality above reality.&quot; When &quot;Avatar&quot; has created a world that is completely spectacular, &quot;Da Ming Xiao&quot; is still on the road of catching up, only to achieve the interaction between humans and orangutans. There is no intention to compare the high and low, but I just want to say that &quot;Da Ming Tang&quot; is very serious, but the story is still a lot of injuries. The joys and sorrows of the film are indeed not as detailed as the director’s predecessor, the &quot;State Representative.&quot; There, the past of each character will give people some feelings, either poverty, or making mistakes, or making up for mistakes, real and interesting. In the past, Zhao Weiwei’s past is more like a baseball that suddenly flies. I don’t know where it comes from. Even if it is from China, the Chinese land we are familiar with always feels how to look awkward. If &quot;Da Ming Xiao&quot; is really positioned as a children&#39;s comedy, then we may not have to ask for so much. [Sohu]"

83,"At the moment of watching this movie, my eyes were tearful, but not to the extent of falling. I feel a thousand words in my throat, but I don&#39;t know where to start. It seems like aphasia. This is a movie I have been waiting for for a long time, this is the third part of my favorite series. When I saw the middle, I thought I would sigh like that. After 18 years, I can still see the sincerity of this three people. It is a wonderful thing in life. Our life will encounter many unpredictable things, and there will always be some encounters, some encounters, some good will make you can not help but sigh, what a wonderful thing to live. Our life can&#39;t be without regrets, no anxiety, no difficulty, Jessie has the hidden pain that he can never make up for his son. Celine has confused herself after being a mother, both confused as a mother and confused that her life no longer belongs to Own, time is divided by more trivial matters, leaving nothing left to give to the passionate, rich, eager to change the world. She is not able to tolerate herself, tolerate things she has not done, tolerate life and tolerate her destiny. So Jesse, who exists in her life, became her unbearable mirror. He knows her so much, even more than herself. When he reminded her of her beauty, he made her think she had separated their father and son, and he made her feel that she could not be as romantic as ever. He showed her a so imperfect self, so she couldn&#39;t believe what he said. He entrusted her with the most important thing in her life and tolerated everything she had. When she met him for the first time, she was a 23-year-old girl, the second was a 32-year-old woman, and now 41-year-old middle-aged mommy, she is still her, the romantic contradictory woman who has many expectations for life, She knew in her heart that the man in front of her eyes was true love. She just couldn&#39;t believe herself. She was afraid that she would end up with the man like she did before, as if the end would be the result of inevitable. She is not sure that this man can still stand her forty-five years. She is not sure, she is worried about this unsure thing. And the last man used a virtual 82 of her letter to her 41 to marry her. That kind of romance. I can&#39;t help but think, why don&#39;t I want to receive a letter of time and space, I will tell you in the future, I will be a better person, I will meet the true love of my life, and accompany him to the old , giving birth to children. I will continue my preferences, go to more places, read more books, and learn more. This man protectionHer fairy tale dream, he carefully cared for this woman, his love in his life. Ps likes a few details in the film: First, in the car, Jessie eats the apple left by her daughter, very warm. Second, my friend spoke about the first question that men and women were waking up in a car accident. Third, the old lady said that she gradually began to forget her husband and felt like she was lost again. How important we have been to some people, but in the end it’s just passing. Fourth, Jessie talks about one of his ideas, a person who will always know each other, a person who can never recognize people, a person who always sees the end of change, a person who always remembers everything, very beautiful and very interesting. Fifth, they sat at the beach watching the sunset, and Celine said that the sun is still there, still, still, gone. Then the two were silent. Fifth, Jessie’s sentence, I love you, seems to have finally ended the three questions about love to an answer. There is no other reason, just because I love you, so I can accept your radiant side and accept your madness, so I accept you as yourself, so I promise you that I will stay with you. 56 years in the past."
84,"When did it start to have a strong interest in the French Revolution. Regarding Louis XVI, Mary Antoinette, Bastille, Gironde and Jacobin, the teachers in the history class just screamed in a critical attitude, leaving more time to stay. Give praise to Mao Zedong’s great leadership. For Hugo, I am extremely respectful. He once wrote to the Captain Bartley about the shameless burning and plundering of the Anglo-French army against the Yuanmingyuan. He expressed his extreme indignation and condemnation (the full text of the letter is attached later in this article). This kind of abandoning racial prejudice looks at the great chest of all mankind and is called &quot;the conscience of France.&quot; Through this book, let me appreciate the other side of Hugo as a sociologist? As an unparalleled writing skill of the writer. Picking up the book and flipping it freely, the dialogue between Robespierre and Mara and others is full of books, which makes me feel that this book will help a little bit to understand the French bourgeois revolution. Hugo&#39;s novels are attached to history, and the evolution of history is based on real history. Similar to Jin Yong, Liang Yusheng or Dumas. However, Victor Hugo’s words are deeper and more profound. There is also his long and tidy description of the scenery and its meticulousness and boring. Although the depiction of the scenery is extremely important and necessary for the later writings, such as the boring front, the development of the latter story will be pale and weak. I have already seen the vivid and subtle depiction of the Notre Dame in nearly 10,000 words in Notre Dame de Paris. In this book, Mr. Hugo is a detailed description of the vast forests, and put forward hundreds of real or fictional names that are completely unrelated to the following texts, and tirelessly readers who are not inferior to the introduction of the number of words of the Notre Dame. Explain the structure of the castles, bridges, and bunkers on the bridge, and their geographical orientation relationship with the highlands, which is enough for the two sides to attack and defend against each other. I have both disappointment and surprises about the work. Disappointingly, I did not read the detailed narrative of the revolutionary events of 1789 that I expected to read through the author&#39;s words that did not bring any political criticism to the Warring States Party and the Revolutionary Party. There is no drunken fan of the Palace of Versailles, there is no smoke in the bottom of the Bastille, and there is no on-the-spot documentary when Louis XVI and Antoinette stepped onto the guillotine. After all, the book&#39;s name is &quot;93&quot; rather than &quot;1989.&quot; All the follow-up history of 1993 is only based on the war between Robespierre and Mara and Dandong to show the opposition between the parties. In other words, as a historical novel, such asI disappointed the four characters of &quot;historical fiction&quot; as a parallel phrase. The part of history really disappoints me, but the fictional part of the novel makes me excited and moved. The flash of the story lies in the author&#39;s life-based three children&#39;s lives on the revolution. The cold Luntnak turned back to the original path for the child, half because of the blood of the Guo Wen family&#39;s benevolence in his body, and the other half is that the three children represent the &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;symmetry&quot; that symbolize the future of France. &quot;Love&quot;, the meaning of saving the child to save the future of France. And the mother of the scarred child, Michelle Fleiss, symbolizes the undamaged current undead in France. The 1/3 of the book&#39;s Huacai chapter fully demonstrates the author&#39;s superb writing skills as a writer and scholar, and his open mind and vision as a philosopher and sociologist, as well as far-sighted analysis and insights into historical events. The success or failure of the book plays a decisive role. The Marquis of Luntnak was turned back for three children, and the prince Guo Wen and the Marquis were free to receive the redemption of the soul. Cao Chang Ladu in the court for Guo Wen to fight for these human touches, showing profound human care and Drama tension. Finally, the author did not take care of the reader&#39;s emotions to avoid Guo Wenyi&#39;s death, but through his mouth to sum up the road to France&#39;s future, so that Guo Wen who published all the opinions died without regret. And West Murden ended his life with a bullet, which is a perfect interpretation of family and law, and the book that has &quot;love&quot; as one of the themes has been qualitatively sublimated. Let the reader cover up in the heart. Sir, you ask me for my opinion on the expedition to China. You think this expedition is decent and beautiful. It is so polite that you value my thoughts so much. In your opinion, this expedition to China under the banner of Queen Victoria and Napoleon is the glory shared by France and England. You want to know to what extent I think I can agree with this victory in Britain and France. Since you want to know, then here is my opinion: there is a world miracle somewhere on the earth, its name is Yuanmingyuan. Art has two principles: philosophy and dreams. The idea has produced Western art, and the dream has produced oriental art. Just as the Parthenon is a representative of the art of ideas, Yuanmingyuan is the representative of fantasy art. It brings together all the results of a people&#39;s imagination that is almost superhuman. Unlike the Parthenon, Yuanmingyuan is not only a unique and unparalleled masterpiece, but alsoCan be called the noble example of fantasy art? If dreams can have a model. You can imagine a fairyland-like building that you can&#39;t describe in words, that is, Yuanmingyuan. This dreamy wonderland is made of marble, white marble, bronze and porcelain. The cedar wood is made of beams, decorated with gems and covered with silk. The altars, the boudoirs and the castles are distributed among them. The gods and ghosts are located inside; the colored glazes, Jin Bisheng Hui; after the poet&#39;s temperament craftsman created a fairyland like a fairy, plus a garden, a pool and a misty fountain, a leisurely swan, white and peacock. In a nutshell: This is a dazzling treasure hole filled with human magical fantasy in the form of palaces and temples. This is the Yuanmingyuan. It was born out of the long-term hard work of two generations. Who built this city-like, cross-century building for whom? It is for the people of the world. Because the crystallization of history belongs to all mankind. Artists, poets, and philosophers all over the world know that there is a Yuanmingyuan, and Voltaire now mentions it. It is often said that there are Batnon in Greece, a pyramid in Egypt, an arena in Rome, Notre Dame in Paris, and Yuanmingyuan in the east. Although some people have never seen it, they all dream of it. This is a shocking, masterpiece that is not yet known to outsiders, like the shadow of distant Asian civilization seen from the horizon of European civilization in the dusk. This miracle is no longer there. One day, two robbers entered the Yuanmingyuan, one looting and one arson. It can be said that victory is the victory of the thief, and the two victors completely destroyed the Yuanmingyuan. People seem to see the name of Elgin, who is notorious for taking the Parthenon back to the UK. What happened at the Butnon farm was repeated in the Yuanmingyuan, and this time it was done more fiercely and thoroughly, so that the tiles did not stay. All the treasures of all our churches add up to this magical and dazzling Oriental Museum. There are not only art treasures, but also countless gold and silver treasures. What a great feat! What a rich and unexpected windfall! The two winners were filled with pockets and the other was filled with cash drawers, then hooked their arms and returned to Europe with a smile. This is the story of two robbers. We Europeans think it is a civilized person, and in our eyes, the Chinese are barbarians, but this is what civilized people do to the barbarians. In the face of history, the two robbers were called France and England. But I want to protest, and I thank you for providing me with such an opportunity. Ruled by the rulerSin is not the fault of the ruler. The government sometimes becomes a robber, but the people will never. The French empire put half of the spoils into its own pockets, and now it is still the owner to show off the exquisite antiques that were taken from the Yuanmingyuan. I hope that one day, France will be able to reinvent itself and wash away the ill-gotten wealth to the looted China. Before that, I would like to testify that there was a theft and the perpetrators were two robbers. November 25, 1861 in Otterville-Haus"
85,"I have to be thankful that after watching Balzac, I saw George Sang. Maybe only in this way, can I have the courage to look at Flaubert. The French revolution in the 19th century was in full swing, and there was no shortage of literary circles from social and historical events. Objectively and realistically reappearing the social reality and became a writing style of writers at that time. However, George Sang is undoubtedly a special existence in her time, and, in my opinion, is also a necessary existence. When reading Balzac&#39;s &quot;The Old Man&quot;, he was really surprised by the author&#39;s &quot;objective reproduction&quot; skill. He quietly brought us into Paris in the early 19th century restoration period, and quietly put us in an unremarkable lower society? Next, a dozen pages of keen, precise, and meticulous descriptions of the environment and depictions of the various characters living in the apartment show us the “lifescape of the lower classes of Paris”. I didn&#39;t pay attention to these at first reading. What I still left in the impression is not the descriptions, but the unforgettable feelings that those descriptions have brought me: dirty, cold, colorful and lifeless; people of different colors do not make I feel strange, but I have already experienced an unstoppable rejection of Hugo’s &quot;tragic world.&quot; Balzac&#39;s world is no more &quot;tragic&quot; than Hugo has brought us, but it is unbearable. Or, this is a &quot;terrorist world&quot; presented by Balzac&#39;s realism. It’s not just me who has this feeling. George Sang in the opening of &quot;Magic Marsh&quot;, &quot;The author to the reader&quot;, describes a print by the German painter Holbein: &quot;This print depicts a farmer cultivating land in the field. The vast fields stretch straight into the distance, I could see a broken wooden house in the distance; the sun fell behind the hills. It was a day after work. The farmer was old, short and dressed, and the four horses he was driving together were skinny. The plough is ploughed into the rugged, hard ground. In this &#39;work and exhaust&#39; scene, only one person is happy and walks softly. This is a fictional character, a hand holding a whip, It ran with the frightened horses running in the furrows and whipped them with a whip, thus giving the old farmer a plow....&quot; George Sang said that the sin in the painting meant death. The farmer is tired all the year round, and his life is miserable. What he finally gets is the call of death. To my surprise, the picture in my mind is strikingly matched to what I just read.The words in &quot;The Old Man&quot; give me an indescribable feeling: all descriptions do not reveal the author&#39;s figure and emotion, but when these words are put together, they feel cold and hopeless, as if there is behind the words. A ruthless devil inexhaustibly draws on the warmth and energy of the author and the reader, just as the death of the goddess in the painting of Holbein is ruthlessly ruthless to the life of the poor. The misfortunes and sufferings brought about by desire and sin are the subject of description and expression by all artists of all ages. George Sang did not ironically ask: &quot;However, we, another century of artists, what will we describe? Will we seek the retribution that humanity deserves today in the mind of death? We will plead for death to punish Is it unfair and compensating for pain?” So she said: “The painter should paint a happy angel next to the painting, and spread the blessed grain in the field that is exuding the heat, instead of painting the hand. The whip, the sad and abominable death in the furrow.&quot; So in &quot;Nana&quot; and &quot;Magic Marsh&quot;, I feel the pleasure of reading to me again?? I mean the one depicted in the book. The life of an ordinary person who is simple, ordinary, and ideal is promised to give a reader a warm hope and a life force. There is no doubt that George Sang and Balzac are two writers who cannot be ignored in the history of world literature. They live in the same era, but the times are quite different in their writings. More people tend to attribute George Sang to the romantic writers. I can&#39;t evaluate this for the time being, because &quot;romanticism&quot; itself is first and foremost a concept that needs to be clarified. But she certainly does not belong to the critical realism of the 19th century, of course, this should not be because of the idyllic pastoral sentiment in his works. George Sang has publicly expressed his disagreement with realism: &quot;Does the novel have to record everything that exists, to record the cold reality of all beings and all things?... I see the phenomenon of life from a completely different perspective. In her letter to Flaubert, she said: &quot;You, don&#39;t have to say, you must write something that hurts people. I want to write something that comforts people.&quot; Whether it is based on the gentle qualities of women or Sang’s childhood experience, her literary view is very different from her mainstream. That is an idealism, but &quot;idealism&quot; always leads to ridicule. Sang Yisheng worships Rousseau and believes in the purification power of nature for humanity. Balzac writes about the materialism of the Parisian city and the natural countryside of SangThe simplicity also provides us with an interesting contrast between modern urban civilization and rural farming civilization. In literary works, the more natural villages are always surrounded by the simple lifestyle and morality of the world. Different from the fact that urban civilization in reality is accompanied by material progress and gradually erodes the pure land of the country, literature preserves a relatively independent ideal world in which one side is not invaded by the outside world. But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a simple &quot;Xanadu&quot;. The novel &quot;Nayong&quot; tells the story of a love story between a lonely girl in the countryside and a noble aristocrat in the monastery. Nayong had no father and no mother since she was a child. She was brought up by her husband, but her simple country and generous nature gave her a character of diligence, simplicity and perseverance. The background of the novel was the period when the Jacobins came to power after the Great Revolution, and the French revolution was resisted by the reactionary forces of Europe. The whole country was trapped inside and outside. In the novel, George Sang also shaped the image of Mr. Koster, a small town lawyer. He is a revolutionary. In the novel, Sang criticized the revolutionary distrust of the peasants through the mouth of Naa, the narrow vision and the abuse of violence. She seems to be interested in maintaining a certain distance from the &quot;reality&quot;, but it is definitely not abandoned. Perhaps the distance itself allows Sang to see the truth of history, and there is an ideal belief above reality. Aristotle has long said: &quot;The poet&#39;s duty is not to describe what has happened, but to describe what may happen, that is, what may happen according to the principle of necessity or necessity.&quot; He said that this is poetry. Different from history. Poetry is higher than history because &quot;poetry is a more philosophical and serious art than history.&quot; Well, I think George Sang has reason to ask Balzac in this way: How can a true poet be able to condescend to history and become its &quot;clerk&quot;?"
86,"A boy told her that if you want to go back, you have to do what I said. Regardless of what her mother-in-law said to her, she only said one thing, &quot;Let me work here.&quot; There is a girl, she has people who want to save, her goals are clear and firm. For her goals, she has things that she has to do, and there are things that she doesn&#39;t have to do. She should go to the bathing pool, she is not good at it, but she works hard.

She is purely as she wants. Give her more, she doesn&#39;t need it. There is a girl, she loves you is not clear, she does not say disgusting to the dirty river god, she said that the faceless person is because of the badness of learning in the soup mother, she does not mind her unscrupulous big-headed baby followed her, she I didn&#39;t feel that the pears were raining because we were knitting a hairline for her. She didn&#39;t look back at the world because the people of the last soup house were kind to her. ==================================================================================== However, I have no feeling of wanting to cry at all. Those who are as calm as me are also thinking about...something? Even if it is not what I need, I took the time to fight, how much time was it wasted? When there are so many passengers, when can I stop using my feelings? Withdrawal of the world that is disturbing, is my current goal still the original one? The last goal I gave up, how did I give up? I have been away for a long time. Where is the ship I am driving? ===================== There is a girl, her name is Chihiro, someone changed her name to Xiaoqian. She almost thought she was Xiao Qian. However, once she knew that she was originally called Chihiro, she promised that she would never forget."
87,"This is also awkward, the plot is unreasonable, the protagonist has no personality charm, and there is no rule in the fight. He is a B-level film. That stick is really a stick, and I just made a plane to do Washington, and the anti-missile Dongdong has a bright spot, quite amazing. Nowadays, the pursuit of special effects in the film market is simply morbid. It is not worthy of scrutiny. After a few years, it is recommended for children to watch. It must be given to SB movies. The world is impetuous, but people are not floating all the time. Ah, can you give it to an IQ?"
88,"In fact, anyone needs to go out, although life is locked in one box after another, but try hard to try what you can do, life may be a little more relaxed, less self-satisfied, because you can do more What? Listening, teaching, guiding, and encouraging seem to be derogatory words. In this case, dear, I did this to you. In fact, the woman with the poison tongue is really full of terrible, but the hateful person has its own pity, especially his own mouth, look up the reason, what is not done, but don&#39;t ask: &quot;Dear, why? you&#39;ve changed?&quot;"
89,"If you haven’t seen the movie, the title “Early See, Late Love” is somewhat confusing. I don’t know if it should be understood as “See you in the morning, good night, my love” or “See you soon, love later”. Or have other meanings, of course, after reading the movie, you will suddenly realize. In comparison, the film&#39;s English name &quot;Day of Redemption&quot;, literally translated as &quot;Redemption Day&quot; should convey the meaning of the film more clearly. The film tells the story of Zhou Yimin&#39;s belly black man Gu Bin and his ex-girlfriend Zhou Tingyin, who has been in love for eight years but eventually broke up, and met in the business circle with the representatives of the acquired party. Because the company represented by Zhou Yimin did not use funds to help Zhou Ting Company to alleviate the financial crisis, but intended to carry out naked annexation, this is like a war without smoke. With only a nine-hour period, Zhou Ting and her partners must use all means to help the company resolve the crisis of being annexed. That is to say, within these 9 hours, Gu Bin and Zhou Ting are the two fronts of each other. They are also engaged in a civil war and a war of love. Here, Gu Bin is a complex character. Although he is black, his jealousy and entanglement (and of course the handsome appearance) make the audience (especially the female audience) hate. Zhou Ting is his eight years. The old love, standing at his opposite side at the moment, the two are not only a little bit unrequited, and even want to renew the meaning of the front. And Aries, the group&#39;s Miss Alice, is his new love. He doesn&#39;t necessarily love her, but Gu Bin knows that winning Alice can earn him wealth and status. It is not only the commercial war between another company but also the complicated emotional entanglement. Gu Bin is indeed somewhat cold, hypocritical, and deceitful, and even for the purpose of seeking a good position, but no need to say more, from the end of the film Gu Bin gave up the chairman of the company. The choice of the position and the week together can know the goodness of his nature. I really like the director’s great treatment. It seems to be a bit of a cliché, but it is just such a director that the word “Redemption” has been perfected. The truth is not only redeemed by the ex-boyfriend lost in the modern commodity society. It also saved the company she and the sisters created together. Director Liu Guochang’s film works have always had a unique perspective. He likes to borrow movies to reflect the current social problems. The same is true of “Seeing Early, Evening Love”, which continues his realistic style, acupuncture, in-depth, meticulous, compact and gentle style. There are some dark colors in the youthful business sentiment, although the ending is complete,But the whole process is constantly showing the harsh reality. &quot;See you early, love late&quot; is a work with realism, the concept is somewhat new, and it may be better to look at it carefully."
90,"It’s not easy to shoot horror movies in China now, because we all know that there is no real ghost in China’s movies, so Chinese directors can only play the concept of “having ghosts in their hearts”. In fact, it’s just three axes. It’s more interesting and interesting to see who plays in the limited rules. Compared with the domestic horror film, the pen-study II that is being discussed is also a new idea. The health is that the horror atmosphere of the film is good from beginning to end. Sitting in the air-conditioned cinema in the summer, I will be scared. Thanks to the addition of the Korean director An Bingji, who is known as the master of ghost films, &quot;Han Xian II&quot; was shot by Han Faner. The film was smooth and the logic was no big problem. The picture was exquisite, suspense was enough, and the actors and actresses were very Eye-catching, a circle of three men and four women, played a crazy killing from campus to society. On the one hand, various large-scale fears, suspense, bloody, and naked elements are constantly displayed on the big screen to stimulate the sensory nerves of the audience. On the other hand, they are to dig the stories and characters to excavate the joy, anger, and sorrow of human nature. , music, love, evil, desire, etc., love, cruelty, beauty and horror, people&#39;s good and evil, beauty and ugliness can all be seen from the film. There are American horror elements, as well as Asian-style elements of &quot;revenge and revenge.&quot; You don’t need to be spoiled to know that the young men and women in the film have already said that they will die one after another. The pens are just an opportunity. Their death is not because there are really ghosts. It is because of their greed and coldness, and that they cannot face and forget the death caused by their own faults. Just as director An Bingji said that it is more horrible than the ghosts and monsters. There can be no people in the world who have no desire for perfection. Everyone has their own personality and pursuit. We cannot say that people have a pursuit of being a mistake, and that pursuit cannot be said to be absolutely equivalent to desire, but if it is not correct and reasonable. It is a mistake to legally pursue your own pursuit. When a person is manipulated by greed and occupied desires, even if only a ghost knows what kind of thing this person will do, this is the original sin of the person. Any display of light and shadow is just a means. The ultimate goal is to convey a value or truth to the audience. The horror film is not just to scare the audience to earn a box office. &quot;Pen Xian II&quot; is the same as most horror movies. Ghost stories to persuade people to be good, there is an old saying in China that &quot;nothing to do, not afraid of ghosts knocking on the door&quot;, not to mention the world has always beenNo ghosts."
91,"Adapted by the award-winning novel of the same name by British author David Mitchell. The director of &quot;The Matrix&quot; Wachowski brothers (now a younger brother) and Tom Tykwer, the director of &quot;Lola Run&quot;, merged together to create such a wonderful film. The rationality, intrinsic relevance, and even the theme and philosophical speculation of the controversy are actually more about novels than movies, because the film retains the general plot and basic ideas of the original. The six stories are summed up in one sentence: In 1849, lawyer Adam Ewing grateful to the black slaves for their help and joined the abolitionist movement; in 1936, the bisexual musician Robert Frobisher was hit by the so-called composer&#39;s crush and threat. Injury of the latter, followed by suicide; in 1973, journalist Luisa Rey traced the safety of nuclear reactions in spite of life-threatening; in 2012, publisher Timothy Cavendish and his companions escaped from the nursing home; in 2144, the cloned Sonmi-451 was rebel After the rescue, the purebred people made public the murder of the clones; in 2321, the surviving human Zachry on the earth got rid of the inner devil and resolutely took the prophet to the top for help. At the end, Zachry told the grandchildren the above story, indicating the human beings of the earth. It will eventually continue. The protagonists of the six stories all have the same birthmark. The same actor in the movie often plays different roles in different eras, all with the color of reincarnation and even reincarnation. But what novels and movies want to express is the repetition of history and the inheritance of human nature; no matter how the world and the environment change, even if you are an insignificant little person, you should stick to love and courage like the six protagonists. It can be seen that the novel and the film&#39;s idea are still using the relatively independent stories of six different eras to illustrate the same theme; except that the previous story is known by the protagonist of the latter story through some channel, the story is not so More echoes and contacts. The novel is written to let the previous story break at the climax, start to tell the next story, do the nesting of 12345654321 (a bit like multiple dreams in The Pirates of Dreams); the movie is processed in parallel, and the six stories start together ( Or flashbacks, together with the climax, the technique is derived from the &quot;Party and the Same&quot;. Both methods have their own merits, and the same way, they all reveal the historical connection, and the line in the play: Our lives are nFrom womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future. Personally, if the three directors can further elaborate on the script and make the story more coherent and interactive, it is more hopeful to become a classic. In all fairness, &quot;Cloud Map&quot; is a novel that is extremely difficult to control and adapt. Six different styles of stories, six different time and space, grand themes, and subtle connections make the general director discouraged. Wachowski&#39;s younger brother and Tom Tykwer are certainly not ordinary people. The addition of the filmmakers is also even more powerful, but even so, the big companies have no idea for the 100 million budget. The three eventually had to embark on the path of independent filmmaking, making this film one of the most expensive independent films in film history. The final box office of the film is flat, the comments are polarized, and the giants who refused are probably secretly happy. This is certainly not comparable to the peak of the three, but I think the film is still worth a look. At least magical makeup is a highlight."
92,"Spend all your time waiting for that second chance.For a break that would make it OK.There’s always some reasons to feel not good enough.And it’s hard at the end of the day.I need some distraction or a beautiful release.Memories seep from my veins.Let me be empty and weightless.And maybe I’ll find some peace tonight.In the arms of the angel.Fly away from here.From this dark, cold hotel room.And the endlessness that you fear.You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie.You are in the arms of the angel.May you find some comfort here.So tired of the straight line.And everywhere you turn.There’re vultures and thieves at your back.The storm keeps on twisting.You keep on building the lies.That you make up for all that you lack.It don’t make no difference, escape one last time.It’s easier to believe.In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness.That brings me to my knees.In the arms of the angel.Fly away from here.From this dark, cold hotel room.And the endlessness that you fear.You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie.You are in the arms of the angel.May you find some comfort here.You are in the arms of the angel.May you find some comfort here."
93,"The works of Hunchun are four stars, and it is obviously a Hong Kong film that is stupid and black. The combination of Qiu Litao and Huang Qiusheng has long been confirmed as a symbol of Hong Kong&#39;s masterpieces. This rhythm is moderate and full of life, but it is not procrastinating and intriguing. But then again, without the contribution of the first two episodes of Donnie Yen, this work cannot reach the current height. Touching the shadows and moving, this is the true portrayal of a generation of masters: there are differences in life, death, illness, friendship, prestige, helplessness, all life, and the right values, right and wrong And ethics, but do not flow to preaching, can be called the best question! Let&#39;s talk about the movements. Although I portray the leaves in my old age, Qiusheng is not as fast as Zi Dan, but Hunchun is authentic. The ultimate battle of the leaves asked the best elbows and elbows to fight, the big show six and a half sticks, and make the spring leg method shine, it is really fun! Unfortunately, it is a pity that I have not been able to reproduce the Eight Diagrams."
94,"Jay Chou’s second self-directed self-edited &quot;Love of the Rooftop&quot; was released in the past six years. It can be seen that Jay Chou’s first career is singing, and the second career should be filming or acting in the past few years. In the past, Jay Chou’s love for movies is almost blind and optimistic. Although he also participated in the blockbuster movie “Golden Armor in the City”, it is actually the three words of Jay Chou, because he is there, he has popularity and box office. Shooting other people&#39;s movies is very limited, so it is very cool to be able to self-directed and self-directed. It can be unrestrained and unfinished. This should be the real cause of Jay Chou&#39;s &quot;Love in the Rooftop&quot;. There is not too much equipment, only to let go of it. Filmmaking is basically a risky investment. Jay Chou’s &quot;Unspeakable Secret&quot; has won the best visual effects, the best original songs and the best outstanding film awards at the Taiwan Golden Horse Awards, and the box office is not very bad. Although it is about a long-lasting love story of youth, the film&#39;s performance techniques are remarkable. Making a movie is actually to please the audience. If it is a commercial blockbuster, the audience is God, and it is not suitable for appetite. This is very commercial and confidential. Some have a good reputation, and some have a good box office. If the word of mouth and the box office are very good, it will be very successful. The temptation of this win-win is the goal that many filmmakers are striving for. It is clear that Jay Chou also wants to develop his second spring in the movie. The appearance of &quot;Love in the Rooftop&quot; is actually the result of Jay Chou&#39;s efforts. &quot;Love in the Rooftop&quot; is still a love story that is loved and loved. It is not high-end or elegant, but seems to be more grounded and more in line with the tastes of many viewers. There are strong love, bloody youth, chivalrous and timid, and more humorous and humorous in Taiwanese youth movies. In fact, this is also a popular light comedy love song and dance film, although the inside is mixed, but sweet but not greasy, spicy and not embarrassing. It is said that Jay Chou&#39;s MV is also good, lively and not mediocre. Every filmmaker is pursuing a film that can gain more recognition from the audience. This shows that the film is a cultural industry. If it is difficult to gain recognition, it seems that this year&#39;s film is a youthful trend. From the beginning of Youth, this heat continues. The spread, while Jay Chou&#39;s &quot;Love in the Rooftop&quot; style is different, it is not so hard, and the subject matter that is familiar to him is the key to success. Although it is still too early to talk about the success of this film, this film is undoubtedly very suitable. Jay Chou&#39;s talents, there are songs and dances, love and love, sadness and joy, Jay Chou through his own music throughout, whenHowever, the dream of his own kung fu hero is implanted in it, and then the romantic love of the lingering silk and the goddess is added, and the touch is on the touch. This play is destined to become the favorite of many people. And the play is full of nostalgic tones, it should be the use of songs to achieve youth. Although the story of a silk star in love with a female celebrity is a bit of a cliché, such an event seems to be common in the entertainment industry. This is also a story that Jay Chou is very familiar with. The goddess has repaid the gambling debts for the father and signed the contract with the boss who did not like it, but he is very much aspired. Free poor love life. In fact, Jay Chou can completely make such a love story a cruel version of the real version, or as extravagant and incorrigible as &quot;Little Times&quot;, but if you do this, the film may be too utilitarian and paying attention, and Jay Chou&#39;s image is absolutely tough. It will appear in an era when heroes are needed. Of course, this nostalgic love is more innocent and touching than the reality of the current market. The film is not perfect, there is a certain focus on the singing and dancing and the storyline, but this is only a commercial operation of the film, it has been very surprising, at least more than the film that Jay Chou participated in, although there are Love is cool and cool, but at least the film meets the tastes of many people. Of course, Jay Chou is not blindly catering to the market. There are many kinds of movie styles. The secret that cannot be said is very pure and romantic, and &quot;Love in the Rooftop&quot; Perhaps the audience will be even better. The prodigal plaster in the film is very buddy and very loyal but more affectionate. Maybe this character seems to be a real Jay. (published in Sanqin Radio and Television News)"
95,"The two clowns drove off the border between the United States and Mexico, and finally rushed into the Mexican border, killing one, and the police found huge sums of money, leaving the only suspect. The prison in Mexico is very free, just like the little boy said, “You can buy anything except jailbreak here.” It’s more like a big free market, unlike a prison, which is different from other movies. . The fugitive met a ten-year-old boy who taught him how to survive here, so they became confidants. The little boy&#39;s liver is needed by the prison boss. The original owner of the money brought by the fugitives has been traced here, and finally this group of people will start a bloody battle. The ending must also be good, and the fugitive went with the leisurely life of the little boy and his mother. Gibson is so old, he has to jump from the building on the side to the building on the other side, and his skill is quite good. The whole piece is full of music from Mexico, and it’s quite cheerful. Although the bridge of taking organs has been staged in countless movies, but Mel’s own scriptwriting is quite different. I feel very good. This foreign country is very powerful."
96,"Perhaps, the old people in this film do not represent the living conditions of all the elderly, but they yearn for good, yearning for happiness, and yearning for the warmth of home. A group of lovely grandfathers and grandmothers, in order to participate in a competition, tried their best to make props and sneak out. Under the night sky, Grandpa told the story that he had heard countless times. &quot;What is that, that is the bird, what is it, it is a bird, that is a bird. When the son said, how many times he said, it is a bird,&quot; or it will be moved, even crying. When we were young, parents took the trouble to tell us this one, and when they were old, we would be impatient, maybe it was inadvertent. However, they may be speechless, tears flowing in their hearts, but they will not speak. Some people say how this is done. I think it can make people feel moved and can tell the story clearly. It is a good movie. At least Zhang Yang did it. Maybe, we should think about it now, our grandparents, grandfathers, moms and dads, they are all good."
97,"There are many handsome guys, many beautiful women... and the captain&#39;s uniform is really super-type... I can say, actually, is I going to chase the drama for this? But, for the shrimps, the terminology for flying, I I feel that this drama is really super-technical, although it should be based on the love of men and women, but whether it is the background of the story, or the intention of the view, I really feel super good! So, I saw the COOL magic ...I fell in love... This feeling is different from that of seeing &lt;a kiss and affection&gt; Furukawa Hiroshi, the COOL demon played by the first brother Zhang Zhilin...wow... gorgeous gorgeous I am handsome and crying... I really feel that my face is not handsome, handsome, handsome, handsome, and handsome. It seems that every actor has a lot of performances... Of course Chen Farah’s acting continues to be remarkable, but I feel that it has improved a lot! In fact, I always feel that a high-rated TV series sometimes needs handsome guys and beautiful women, but in terms of story scripts, this I heard the Mandarin spoken by Ma Guoming in the play... Haha... It’s really interesting..."

The old king has been hard to steal Helen, in order to exercise his own strength, take care of the fairy to grow up! ? Even Helen’s beautiful people can sit still! Conclusion: Still the actors are not beautiful enough. When Mi Naulus became so sympathetic and indecisive, instead of taking the opportunity to kill Paris, the two of them still talked about it? You are a warrior, you are the king of Sparta, hector and achilles. The battle seems to have been going on for a whole day. Here, the two men’s javelins are set to die. The achilis let hector a round, but the hector’s soft hector does not go. It was set on the stake. Hector, your lifelong mission is, I defense my country, how come when you are fighting, even the woman&#39;s benevolence, forget how powerful you were when you killed your brother! Paris is revengeful, and if there is help from God, the Greek first warrior will be stumped. Although the sun god secretly helped, but there are woods that come too suddenly. There are countless Trojan warriors who have a handful of achilis for ten years. How can they not be reflected here? It is obviously a period of time. . . .

99,"Like most of the mango-produced thunder dramas, the drama still adheres to its consistent tradition of &quot;character teeth, mentally retarded, shameful shame, and sincere feelings.&quot; The scent of dog blood is full of logic. The wounds and swaying appeared in front of the world, but fortunately, the male and female masters are very eye-catching, and the love is always good. Why should I pretend to be high-end, and it is rare that Loli is just too well, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots, even if not Look at the face and look at the male master this handsome face! However, we don’t have to look at it. It’s a remake. The conditional reflexes scream and ruin the classics. Every mango drama god has been used to drink Sanlu’s wings. The lack of congenital breast milk leads to their lack of security. Only on the shoulders of the former drama, they can be able to compose the peace of mind. Moreover, the predecessor of this drama is not a classic of the gods. At most, it is the dog’s bloody words in the costumes of the myths of the costumes, and people would rather not smash the bad movies. Contamination of the classic, this light can be smashed by someone who is not only 18th Street honey cannabis! It was not until I saw the film that I discovered that the drama was not only adapted to &quot;Fish Beauty&quot; but also into &quot;Bao Qingtian&quot;. It is also possible that the filmmaker originally planned to remake the young boy, but because he could not find the nostrils, he was loyal to the original. The special actor decided to change the string later. Although the male lord Xiaozhenzi said that the reincarnation of the small bag will not be able to unite the neighbors in the neighborhood, and the self-study of the growth path of the public law lawyers of the national law, it seems to be closer to the Avanti, especially the first In one episode, he took a fishing rod and sang Zhang Ronggui&#39;s section. The strong Afantipai is a visual sensation. It is true that Xiaoguizi, who is a well-known village, is a local villager who has fallen into such a field. The sac is dead, the fishing rod is not arrogant, the female tyrants are not arrogant, go to the gallery to fight and robbed and be used as a monkey. I said Xiaozhenzi, you have your own GPS tracking navigator, and you are not afraid of the bad guys. This cliff is true love, I am going! ! Different from the old version of the worries and the waste of firewood and weak books, Zhang Ziyou, our little treasures can sell Meng will be foolish, understand the law, or be a good boy who is brave and courageous. It’s no wonder that even the general attack of the micro-service privately-funded is too expensive. Take the initiative to be a brother with him! The new version of the squid fine is a good art that is both cute and natural, and she is a little illiterate. She has a little guilty. She has a little local tyrant who also has a little mana. I remember that in the old version, I said that I had to rely on Ding Yuanzhu (it seems to call this name). The fairy can get a fairy, so I can help.The monsters come back and you fight for me to grab this pig, and they are not particularly hygienic. You spit it out and I swallowed it. The saliva is shining, and the new version is more civilized. What era is still robbing the horse, look at the egg hurt, bribe the boss is the last word! and then. . . I don’t want to vomit the gift from the sister paper. A second-hand rag head. . Still worn by the dead. . Of course, the Dragon King was very angry. When he was angry, he sent the sister paper to match the male and female. . (There is a relationship between the two!)

If you are a reasoning controller, I advise you not to abuse yourself. After 10 years, Ke fans said that they are really refreshing after watching. What is even more irritating is that we are just an NPC, not only in the &quot;smart&quot; In front of the group of people, &quot;Gan Bai Xiafeng&quot;, even a student can not win the gold tutor, it is really the tiger fell Pingyang was bullied by the dog, Xie Ding&#39;s phoenix is ​​not as good as the chicken!

The &lt;Fish Beauty&gt; years ago can be said to be my Lily Enlightenment. At the same time, I also had the first close contact with the corpse, and the time was not so urgent. Therefore, major local satellite TVs have also been able to introduce a number of excellent overseas animations headed by the New Century Skyhawks, but there is a XX TV that is hot and beautiful, and it always has a windmill from 6 pm to 7 pm.

I don’t want to save the beauty, but also make a small wife-in-law to blame others for taking his first night, falling into the hands of the monsters and needing women. The main rescue, the female host in the hands of the oil and rescue, it is a pity that such an obvious M orientation is not to accept the repayment, he is probably the most impotent man I have ever seen, in addition to the film The monsters also left an indelible mark on my childhood. The group performances of the monsters are the conscience of the industry. They are all claws and face-to-face. The personal feeling of removing the love part can be seen as a horror film. In the new version, the group of red men and green women combed the haircut of Matthew, wore a horse shochu, and spoke with a sigh of relief."
100,"Some of Liu Zhenyun’s works have been read intermittently. The small forest in the “Unit” and “Chicken of the Land” grew up under the reform and opening up and the market economy. Many historical figures in the “Hometown” series encircle the historical reality, nothing more than Liu Zhenyun’s black humor. The language reveals his embarrassment as a writer. The characters are not important. What is important is to dispel the grand narrative in the historical context, to defeat the tall and complete, and to return a real name to the world. In Liu Zhenyun&#39;s works, you can almost see too many postmodernist techniques, rather than the pure modernity of the sorrowful, magical realism, in the &quot;hometown circulate&quot;, the six fingers of the excess fingers set up a bridge, let Hundreds of thousands of immigrant Yanjin people have successfully crossed the Yellow River. In the new historicalism, in the &quot;Hometown of the Yellow Flower&quot;, the village committee cadres are not headed for the people like the textbooks of history. Instead, they ride on the people&#39;s heads to make a fortune and fight. Through the ubiquity of historical figures in &quot;The Story of Hometown&quot;, Liu Zhenyun also broke the traditional narrative, and the meta-fictional narrative technique has stirred up the history. At the end of the day, it’s a slap in the word, it’s written in a fascinating way, and it’s nothing more than a slap in the face. It’s nothing more than a ready-made material. It’s nothing more than an attempt to dispel the real, blinded review. Writing strategies, in terms of materials, are neither beneficial nor serious. Everyone can write novels, but not everyone is a novelist, and not everyone is a writer. Mr. Liu Zhenyun is more willing to put it between the novelist and the writer. Once the language of Liu Zhenyun&#39;s novels is heard, everyone can imitate it. Secondly, Liu Zhenyun&#39;s delicate observation is unparalleled. In &quot;Wen Wen 1942&quot;, it is to use data to speak, half is like late reportage, and in &quot;Unit&quot;, &quot;One Place Chicken&quot;, the language of the new realist writer is infinitely close to real life, unlimited The degree of closeness to the real life of rice, oil and salt, unlimited feelings helpless, and even a little gloating. In the &quot;Hometown&quot; series, this language has flooded to the extreme, and the fart is flying, and the spit is smeared. Although it likes the extreme, the language&#39;s popularization restricts the theme to a deeper level. The biggest characteristic of Liu Zhenyun is that he can go freely in the switching between the microscope and the magnifying glass. His microscope is generally meticulously observing life. In the &quot;Unit&quot; &quot;The Chicken in a Field&quot;, he is alert to the possibility of a loose political atmosphere, and the fledgling The growth of Kobayashi is a true portrayal of the history of this loose atmosphere. If a person wants to grow, he must be washed by the unit.Practice can only succeed. In the &quot;Hometown&quot; series, he keenly wrote that the subtle relationship between people changes the existence of the hidden class with the difference of economic status and power possession, and the story of &quot;The Hometown Gossip&quot; from the Three Kingdoms Period The bear-like look turned into a heroic village party secretary for 59-61 years. The different attitudes of the dogs are the proof. During the great migration period of the Ming Dynasty, the people’s return to the six-finger attitude was also supported. Liu Zhenyun’s magnifying glass tells a weak, humble, bullying and hard-working nation through these small things that seem to be overwhelmed by historical floods. It has always been used in power changes for thousands of years. In &quot;Hometown of the Yellow Flower&quot;, large-scale slogans and policies were replaced by the game of power. The power given by the people to be the master of the house was swallowed up by flattery, selfishness, and numbness, for thousands of years. I remember listening to Liu Zhenyun’s speech once. He said that he wanted to write the old forest 30 years later. Xiaolin was 30 years ago. The old forest is 30 years later, and people may not. He perceives changes in social trends, and we will not be remembered by history. However, changes in history and society will bring about changes in the principles of affairs and interpersonal relationships. In the context of small people, it is a pity that genes are not necessarily. Got the money. In a carnival-like discourse magnetic field made up of rough language, it is enchanting and fascinating. I waited for the heavenly ass, the dance of the natural hand."
