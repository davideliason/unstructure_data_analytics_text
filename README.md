# Unstructured Data Analysis (Text Mining)
## Data representation
### Text Representation
Working with Python 3 and Jupyter tools.

Unstructured Data Analytics Process
• Text Representation
- characters, words, phrases, parts-of-speech
---------------
– Word level information:
**Tokenization**: a simple representation
- This is where we split sentences into pieces called tokens
- tokens can also be different units, like character, word, sentence
• Bag of words
The problem is that there are too many dimensions, such as having different forms of a word but the same meaning. We can **normalize** using stemming or lemmatization.
• Stemming: 
    A process of transforming a word into its stem, base or root form (normalized form) by removing its affix
• Lemmatization • TFI‐DF
– Phrase level information • N‐grams
– Part‐of‐speech level information • POS
• Parse Tree
